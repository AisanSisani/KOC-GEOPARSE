      "LONDON, March 6 (AFP)\n",
      "Two men were arrested Wednesday in connection with bomb attacks on mainland Britain that police claim were organised by the dissident Irish republican group the Real IRA, police said.\n",
      "The men, aged 42 and 43, were arrested at addresses in central and western England early Wednesday and were being questioned by police in Leeds, northeast England, a spokeswoman said.\n",
      "The men, who were not named, were both arrested under anti-terrorism legislation.\n",
      "The Real IRA, a splinter group of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), opposes the peace process in Northern Ireland and has been blamed for a series of attacks since splitting from the mainstream IRA in 1997.\n",
      "Two men appeared in a London court in February, charged in connection with the same bomb attacks in London and Birmingham. They remain in custody pending trial.\n",
      "In March, a taxi exploded in front of the BBC's London headquarters, injuring one person. In August, four people were slightly injured when a car bomb exploded in Ealing, west London.\n",
      "And in November, a car bomb went off in a car park in Birmingham, causing no casualties.\n",
      "The Real IRA was thrust to the forefront of the Northern Ireland crisis in 1998, when it was blamed for killing 29 people in a bomb blast in Omagh market, the single most devastating atrocity in over 30 years of violence in the province.\n",

      "ATTENTION\n",
      "UPDATES throughout, ADDS detail ///\n",
      "CHAMONIX, France, March 9 (AFP) - The Mont Blanc tunnel linking France and Italy re-opened Saturday, three years after a horrific fire killed 39 people and closed it down, prompting a re-think of security on the Alps' motorways.\n",
      "Italians generally welcomed the tunnel opening, but some 1,500 demonstrators gathered on the French side in Chamonix to condemn the pollution caused by the heavy truck traffic through the important Alpine road link.\n",
      "Italian Interior Minister Claudio Scajola, joined by some 1,000 people dressed in their Sunday finest, walked several hundred meters (yards) into the tunnel to mark the opening, calling it a \"historic day for Europe\".\n",
      "On the French side, regional officials attended the official ceremony, but other elected officials led by Chamonix mayor Michel Charlet protested against the resumption of truck traffic on the roadway, set for March 25.\n",
      "In the Italian ski town of Courmayeur, one kilometer (half a mile) from the tunnel's Italian entrance, 30 environmental activists dressed in white also called for an end to truck traffic.\n",
      "Earlier Saturday, an explosive device used to trigger avalanches was thrown at the tunnel's entrance, damaging a van and triggering an alarm.\n",
      "Although the attack was not immediately claimed, authorities worried that protests could mar the tunnel's long-awaited re-opening.\n",
      "\"This is a move by people who believe that we should close an international link in th K-Pje of some abstract environmentalism,\" Scajola said of the attack during the official ceremony`Dp9ning the tunnel's Italian side.flour and margarine caught fire in the middle of the tunnel, filling the space with choking smoke and blocking traffic in both directions.\n",
      "The fire quickly spread and gained in intensity, defying firefighters' efforts to battle it for more than two days.\n",
      "The 39 killed either choked to death or were burned to death as they blindly tried to escape the tunnel on foot.\n",
      "The victims of the disaster \"are the factor that made all that is happening today possible and they paid dearly -- they paid with their lives,\" Scajola said, praising the tunnel's new security measures.\n",
      "On the French side, two Greeks driving a car registered in Britai4 Were the first to reach the tunnel toll gate, beating a Frenchman who had been waiting since early morning to ensure he would be the first to pass through.\n",
      "Drivers sounded their car horns as they crossed through the tunnel and waved to one another.\n",
      "France and Italy have poured some 350 million euros (320 million dollars) into safety features for the 11.6-kilometer (7.2-mile) long tunnel, including an escape corridor under the roadway and a doubling of emergency shelters.\n",
      "Earlier, victims' relatives gathered with authorities for a mid- morning prayer service in the middle of the tunnel, and later placed flowers and wreathes at the tunnel opening.\n",
      "The tunnel's re-opening was pushed back for nearly one year, with France calling for more security tests while Italy lamented the loss that the tunnel's closure caused its export industry.\n",
      "Rome has said the closure cost its economy 2.6 billion euros, as the tunnel was the country's single most important export route.\n",
      "Truck traffic will be heavily regulated, authorities have said, in an attempt to ensure that the 1999 catastrophe will neve21a & repeated.\n",
      "Only 1,100 trucks will be allowed to pass through the tunnel per day, less than half of the level allowed before the tunnel's closure in 1999.\n",
      "The number of trucks in the tunnel at any given time will also be heavily regulated, forcing drivers to park at either entrance before being allowed to pass through.\n",

      "ATTENTION\n",
      "UPDATES with end of hostage-taking, ADDS police quotes ///\n",
      "AMSTERDAM, March 11 (AFP) - A lone gunman, apparently angry at a Dutch maker of widescreen televisions, held 18 people hostage for seven hours in an Amsterdam office building on Monday before committing suicide, officials said.\n",
      "The 59-year-old man, who was not identified, stormed into the lobby of the 36-story Rembrandt office tower at about 9:20 am (0820 GMT), taking 18 people hostage, said Leo De Wit, spokesman for the Amsterdam prosecutor's office.\n",
      "The man immediately contacted police and began negotiating, De Wit said, adding that in the course of the day, he released five women and two men, leaving 11 hostages.\n",
      "The ordeal ended at about 4:30 pm, when the man shot himself twice in the head after asking police for a break in negotiations, De Wit said, adding the 11 were \"fine\" and had been taken to a nearby police station for questioning.\n",
      "The man, who hailed from the town of Uithoorn just south of Amsterdam, carried two weapons -- a semi-automatic weapon and a handgun -- and was visibly agitated and confused, the spokesman said.\n",
      "He also had a suitcase which he claimed contained explosives. Police analysis showed that the bag contained chemicals that in the right mixtures could have been dangerous, De Wit said.\n",
      "\"He objected to broadband widescreen TV and he wanted this to be known to the people,\" the spokesman noted.\n",
      "Some 200 police officers, along with fire rescue crews and ambulances, were rushed to the scene as the drama unfolded.\n",
      "But the man's suicide came as a complete surprise to negotiators, De Wit said.\n",
      "Amsterdam police commissioner Joop van Reissen characterized the man as \"very confused\".\n",
      "Electronics giant Philips, which manufactures widescreen televisions, once had offices in the Rembrandt Tower, but relocated to a nearby building last year.\n",
      "During the day, the hostage-taker admitted that he had staged his assault on the wrong building, De Wit said.\n",
      "The Rembrandt Tower currently houses several major companies, including international brokerage house Merrill Lynch and US investment bank Lehman Brothers.\n",
      "But the suspect was apparently targetting Philips, allegedly for their promotion of widescreen televisions.\n",
      "Dutch television NOS reported that the hostage-taker had sent a fax to them in which he proclaimed to be fighting \"widescreen televisions.\"\n",
      "The hostage-taker complained that salespeople were promoting the new television screens as \"better looking than normal screens,\" said a NOS spokesman, quoting the fax.\n",
      "\"What you gain in width, you lose in height,\" the suspect protested, according to the report.\n",
      "The man has been fighting the sale of widescreen televisions for more than a year, the fax added.\n",
      "Posters that read \"We mislead\" in English could be seen on some of the office windows. A witness quoted by Dutch television said the suspect had forced hostages to stick up the signs.\n",
      "Other posters with the phrase \"Kleisterlee lies\" -- referring to Philips chief executive Gerard Kleisterlee -- were visible from the windows on several floors of the building.\n",

      "Members of the Communist union the CGT told AFP that the haul dumped in the streets was the result of several days of seizures of Metro, a daily freesheet owned by the Swedish group Metro International.\n",
      "The remains of the protest thickly littered Rue Quatre Septembre leading between AFP's headquarters in Place de la Bourse and the Place de l'Opera 400 metres (yards) away.\n",
      "As rain turned the papers to pulp traffic was slowed as if crossing thick snow.\n",
      "Metro was launched in Paris on February 18 and immediately ran into opposition from the French press industry's entrenched union interests.\n",
      "Protesters claim that free newspapers threaten jobs and titles in the paid-for sector and the CGT has been running a guerrilla campign, harrassing distributors and seizing deliveries.\n",
      "Metro International insists that the title, a 14-page colour tabloid paid for by advertising, is aimed at young people and women who buy few traditional papers and represents to no threat to the industry.\n",

      "A group of some 250 Kurds protested Wednesday that they had been subject to \"physical and psychological pressure\" after being blocked from travelling through Romania.\n",
      "The group, heading from western Europe for a meeting in Turkey, have been ordered back into Hungary after being blocked for over 24 hours at the Hungarian-Romanian border at Nadlac, they said in a statement.\n",
      "Specifically they were \"victims of physical and psychological pressure, before being sent back into Hungary,\" said the organizers of the group, heading to a meeting in western Turkey on the use of the Kurdish language.\n",
      "Travelling in six coaches, the Kurds arrived on the Hungarian-Romanian border on Monday evening and were initially given authorization to travel through Romania to Bulgaria, en route to Turkey.\n",
      "But after the first coach was allowed through, the Romanian government said it was informed by the Bulgarian government that Sofia had banned the Kurds from crossing its territory.\n",
      "The Kurds were therefore blocked at Nadlac, where they were put under close surveillance by some 250 military police.\n",
      "The affair, which comes during a visit by Turkey's interior minister to Bucharest, risks embarrassing the Romanian government notably because it is counting on Turkish support to be invited to join NATO later this year.\n",

      "\"They must know that they will not stop change and will not stop the job of this government and its majority\" in parliament, he added in his five-minute address.\n",
      "\"The government will move forward on the road to reforms, we must do so in memory of Marco Biagi,\" the prime minister said, praising Biagi for his \"competence\", \"modern vision\" and his spirit as an \"innovator.\"\n",

      "The unions are also threatening a general strike before the end of April to protest the labor reforms.\n",
      "The Red Brigades said in a statement claiming the murder that Biagi was \"executed\" for his role in the bid to overhaul existing labour laws.\n",
      "Saying it was engaged in \"a war with the State,\" the group charged that \"the capital crisis has forced the imperialist bourgeoisie ... to redefine its means of exploitation ... and maintain its profit margins.\"\n",

      "Scajola said his murder came \"at a time of particular social tension\", while Berlusconi accused unions and leftwing parties of creating a poisonous atmosphere that was the backdrop for the slaying of Biagi.\n",
      "\"One must stop considering adversaries as enemies. We must end the spiral of political hatred and a deadly way of speaking worthy of a civil war,\" Berlusconi said after the killing.\n",
      "Police believe Biagi's killers are a second-generation group of the Red Brigades who sowed terror across Italy twith bombings and assassinations that included the kidnapping and murder of Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978.\n",

      "Chirac was categorical on Monday in his refusal to debate with the National Front leader. At a rally in the western city of Rennes, he was cheered to the rafters when he declared: \"In the face of intolerance and hate, no dealing is possible, no compromise is possible, no debate is possible.\"\n",
      "He pointed out that he had always refused to strike a deal with Le Pen in previous presidential elections, even when it had meant certain defeat for himself, and he had no intention of conferring a spurious legitimacy on his extremist opponent now.\n",
      "\"I will not accept the banalisation of violence and hatred,\" he said. \"Just as in the past I have never entered into an alliance with the National Front, whatever the political price there was to pay, so I will not now take part in a debate with its representative.\"\n",
      "It was a decision which will disappoint not only Le Pen but also a large majority of the country, as an opinion poll published in the Le Parisien newspaper on Wednesday morning showed that 69 percent of the population wanted just such a debate.\n",
      "Le Pen, for his part, was scathing of Chirac's refusal. Speaking on state-run television, he slammed the refusal as \"an intolerable, inadmissable attack on the rules of democracy, and the fact that it comes from the president... is a scandal.\"\n",
      "But there was support for Chirac from an unlikely quarter, Socialist former justice minister Robert Badinter, who arranged face-to-face election confrontations for the late Francois Mitterrand.\n",
      "In an interview in Le Parisien, Badinter said: \"A face-to-face meeting between Chirac and Le Pen would run the risk of degenerating, at Le Pen's instigation, into an undignified slanging match. The worst moments would be televised round the world and France's standing abroad has nothing to gain from that, anymore than the democratic debate has.\"\n",
      "Le Pen, meanwhile, was having talks Wednesday with France's Broadcasting Authority to complain at the \"partiality\" of the way he has been portrayed on television and to press his demand for \"the respect of moral and legal rules of equality which apply in such circumstances in order for the French people to be fairly informed.\"\n",
      "There was every sign Wednesday that Chirac had no intention of underestimating his opponent, even though he has the endorsement of almost the entire political spectrum, still shaken by Le Pen's emergence as a serious threat in Sunday's first round and his boast that he can cause a second upset by actually winning.\n",
      "While there have been indications that he should win by a landslide and many commentators are predicting that Le Pen will not poll more than 20 percent of the vote, Chirac is reported to be wary of complacency.\n",
      "According to the left-leaning newspaper Liberation, Chirac believes that Le Pen is quite capable of attracting a staggering 35 percent of the vote and thus pave the way for a further bombshell in June's elections for the National Assembly.\n",
      "\"They won't be a stroll, they are going to be tough,\" a Chirac aide is quoted as saying, fearing that the National Front could cause a three- way run-off in between 150 and 200 constituencies.\n",
      "However, the opinion poll in Le Parisien shows that respondents are still extremely wary of the Front. It is viewed as a racist organisation by 68 percent of the people, and as an outright threat to democracy by 76 percent.\n",

      "Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was stabbed Wednesday in an attack in Stockholm and rushed to hospital for surgery, days ahead of a euro referendum in which she has been a high-profile campaigner.\n",
      "Lindh, 46, and one of her country's most popular politicians, was injured in the arm and the abdomen by an unknown assailant in a crowded downtown department store.\n",
      "Her condition was serious but not life-threatening, police spokeswoman Stina Wessling told AFP, adding that her attacker was still at large.\n",
      "Prime Minister Goeran Persson immediately issued an order to step up security for ministers, and suspended the \"yes\" campaign in the run-up to Sunday's referendum on Swedish euro entry.\n",
      "\"We are suspending all campaigning until further notice,\" Persson told reporters just four days ahead of Sunday's vote.\n",
      "The attack conjured up memories of the assassination of former Prime Minister Olof Palme in as he was leaving a cinema in downtown Stockholm in 1986.\n",
      "Like Palme, and many top level Swedish politicians, Lindh was not accompanied by bodyguards.\n",
      "She was not on the campaign trail when she was stabbed but visiting the Nordiska Kompaniet department store privately, police said. She was rushed to Stockholm's Karolinska hospital where she was immediately operated on.\n",
      "\"She has a serious injury in the abdomen and we cannot say anything about her condition until the operation is completed,\" Lindh's spokesman Dan Svanell told the TT news agency.\n",

      "Police said they had no indication of any threats against Lindh before the incident.\n",
      "Lindh is a key member in Persson's Social Democratic government, and regularly tipped as a possible successor.\n",

      "About 160,000 postal workers belonging to the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) have voted since late August on whether to stage a nationwide walkout in a protest over pay. The result was due at 2:00 pm (1300 GMT).\n",
      "Last-ditch talks aimed at averting the industrial action were adjourned late Tuesday without any sign of agreement, a CWU spokesman said.\n",
      "The prospect of a strike paralysing a key part of the British communications network has caused nervousness among firms, though Royal Mail is understood to have drawn up contingency plans to limit the chaos.\n",
      "Royal Mail, wholly owned by the government, has more than 200,000 employees delivering mail and parcels, as well as staffing Post Office branches.\n",
      "The group, which made a pre-tax loss of 611 million pounds (884 million euros, 957 million dollars) in the year to March, is struggling to cut costs and modernise in the face of growing competition from private sector operators.\n",
      "The latest row comes as the business is trying to push through a restructuring package which would include the loss of as many as 30,000 jobs, and the end of twice-a-day mail delivery.\n",
      "The operator has offered its staff a pay hike of 14.5 percent over 18 months linked to productivity improvements, but the CWU has rejected the proposed deal, complaining the offer contains \"more strings than the philharmonic orchestra\".\n",

      "The ideal microbicide would not require further metabolism, such as a chemical, to make it work; it would be stable inside and outside the vaginal cavity; and it would not require refrigeration, he said.\n",
      "But the hunt for it has been hampered by scientific setbacks, by the wily shape-changing nature of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and by a chronic lack of interest from Big Pharma, he said.\n",
      "Initially, scientists cast around for a microbicide that worked in \"a non-specific way\" against HIV -- tough compounds that not only destroyed HIV but other micro-organisms as well.\n",
      "yme on the virus surface, preventing the virus from integrating its DNA with that of the immune cell.\n",
      "Some of these, notably compounds called PMPA, UC781 and Calanolide A, have performed well in various tests using tissue cultures, macaque monkeys and mice that have been genetically modified to replicate the symptoms of AIDS.\n",
      "Other possibilities are using these drugs with other compounds to attack multiple targets on the virus, such as a molecule like T-20, which blocks the virus before it attaches to a cell.\n",
      "But there is still a long way to go before any of the candidate treatments gets out of the lab and into human trials, a three-phase process of testing for safety and effectiveness that can take years.\n",
      "And even so, many uncertainties remain. Some microbicides may not ward of new, resistant forms of the fast-mutating virus.\n",
      "And instead of acting as a barrier in the vaginal or anal wall, some microbicides could be absorbed into the bloodstream -- not enough to kill the virus, but enough to encourage it to mutate into a resistant form.\n",
      "Wainberg said the frustrations of finding a microbicide almost exactly mirrored those of the search for an HIV vaccine.\n",
      "Part of the problem, he said, was \"we have not done a very good job in involving the major pharmaceutical companies of the world,\" which had little interesting in pursuing research for a product, sold in poor countries, that would yield little profit.\n",
      "Just as in vaccines, a way had to be found by governments and agencies to provide a profit incentive for research, and leave it to donations to bring down the cost for poor countries when the product finally reaches the market, he said.\n",

      "\"Have confidence that these principles can be advanced in Labour policies for our time,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Have confidence that Labour values are the values of the British people. This Labour Party -- best when we are boldest. Best when we are united. Best when we are Labour.\"\n",
      "Brown's address in Bournemouth, on England's south coast, followed a new opinion poll Monday in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, revealing that 74 percent of voters now are dissatisfied or unhappy with Blair's government.\n",
      "Seventy percent said Blair had \"lost touch with ordinary working people,\" and 54 percent said it was wrong for Britain to get involved in the Iraq conflict.\n",
      "The Labour party itself won the support of only 31 percent, the lowest since Blair took over the leadership in 1994.\n",
      "Brown has long been regarded as Blair's main rival within Labour, and he remains untainted by the fallout that has followed the Iraq war, including the suicide in July of government weapons expert David Kelly.\n",
      "Though looking tired and less photogenic than the prime minister, Brown -- in a sombre suit and red tie -- nevertheless managed to convey both passion and gravity Monday, earning him a standing ovation of some two minutes.\n",
      "In a hall packed with fellow ministers and delegates, he touted the economic success of six years of Labour government, in a speech peppered with references to social justice and traditional Labour values.\n",
      "\"While America and Japan have been in recession, while half of Europe is still in recession, Britain with a Labour Government, pursuing Labour policies, has achieved economic growth in every year, indeed in every quarter of every year, for the whole six and a half years of this Labour government,\" he said.\n",
      "He mocked the opposition Conservatives, saying it was Labour that would best guard the wealth of the nation.\n",
      "\"As long as I am chancellor, I will never ask you to abandon fiscal responsibility, never to set aside economic discipline, never to abandon long term reform for quick fixes, never to succumb to Tory short-termism,\" he said.\n",
      "But on Iraq, Brown made only a passing reference, saying it was \"right to back our leader Tony Blair\" in his efforts \"to bring security and reconstruction\" in the wake of the US-led war against Saddam Hussein.\n",
      "Political analysts expect Blair to use his speech Tuesday to try and reassert his authority over Labour in the face of internal opposition to his domestic reform agenda.\n",
      "Most controversial among those reforms are plans to jack up university tuition fees, and the granting of more management autonomy to selected hospitals within the underfunded and understaffed National Health Service.\n",

      "Nine out of 10 cigarette-sellers closed for the day and 60 demonstrations were planned across the country. During the morning protesters blocked a cigarette warehouse at Lognes east of Paris and newspaper depots at Calais and Amiens in the north.\n",
      "Monday saw a 20 percent increase in tobacco prices, the second this year following an eight percent rise in January. A further increase on January 1 will mean an average packet of 20 cigarettes will have gone up from 3.6 euros to 5.5 euros (4.2 - 6.4 dollars).\n",
      "\"The government says loud and clear that it wants the day to come when there is not a single smoker left in France. What I want is to make sure that our network of 34,000 traders doesn't disappear as well,\" said Rene Le Pape, president of the Confederation of Licensed Tobacco Sellers.\n",
      "French tobacconists have a monopoly on cigarette sales and take a percentage of every packet sold. Their shops are also licensed outlets for postage stamps as well as government excise and fine payment stamps.\n",
      "\"Right now 1,500 tobacconists are on the point of selling up. Another 5,000 are in great difficulties but could pull through if there is help. The number of bankruptcies has gone up by 57 percent in a year,\" Le Pape said.\n",
      "The centre-right government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has made it a priority to bring down the country's stubbornly high smoking figures. Around 42 percent of the population are smokers and more than half of 19-year-olds.\n",
      "Last week the education ministry launched a campaign to have an existing ban on smoking in public places fully enforced in secondary schools -- prompting walk-outs by students in two establishments protesting against the prohibition.\n",
      "But opposition politicians have also accused the government of using cigarette tax as an easy money-earner at a time when state finances are in the red and the EU has been threatening sanctions because of an over-stretched budget deficit.\n",
      "Health Minister Jean-Francois Mattei hinted there might be room for compromise on the timing of January's planned price rise. \"We will see if it is appropriate for it to take place in January or if it should be postponed a short while,\" he told RTL radio Monday.\n",
      "But he said the government's aim remained to reduce the number of young smokers by 30 percent and the number of adult smokers by 20 percent in five years. \"The rise in tobacco prices will be used so as to permit us to reach that objective,\" he said.\n",
      "The tax increases will put France among the most expensive countries in Europe for smokers. The same average packet of cigarettes costs 2.5 euros in Spain, 2.85 euros in Luxembourg and 3.7 euros in Belgium. Britain and Norway have the highest charges, at over seven euros a packet.\n",
      "French tobacconists in border regions say their business is being ruined by the huge differential in prices, because there is nothing to stop consumers driving to neighbouring countries to stock up.\n",
      "But police are more concerned at the rise in large-scale smuggling, which is already estimated to account for up to 30 percent of cigarette sales in Britain. Customs officials regularly make seizures of lorry-loads of contraband tobacco bound for the Channel ports.\n",
      "Tobacconists argue that too fast a rise in official prices will drive much of the market underground, depriving the government of income but making little impact on consumption.\n",

      "The three unions -- the left-wing CGIL, the Roman Catholic CISL and the moderate UIL, which together claim 11 million members -- said in a joint statement they were also considering calling a new general strike against the reforms.\n",
      "The unions say 10 million people took part in a half-day strike against the pension review on October 24, which paralysed schools, public services, airports and factories across much of the country.\n",
      "The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- faced with an ageing population and a ballooning pensions bill -- wants to increase the number of years employees must contribute to the pension scheme before they can retire with full benefits.\n",
      "On Tuesday Berlusconi said the government was prepared to hold talks with union to \"improve\" the planned reforms but warned it was not prepared to ditch them altogether.\n",
      "The three unions rejected the offer.\n",
      "\"There's nothing to discuss,\" UIL leader Luigi Angeletti said bluntly.\n",
      "Italy has seen three nationwide stoppages since the right returned to power in May 2001, after 20 years of relative industrial calm.\n",

      "Corsican separatists spurn French interior minister's offer of dialogue by Marc Burleigh\n",
      "PARIS, Oct 29 (AFP)\n",
      "Separatists on Corsica and the French government stepped up their struggle to control the Mediterranean island's future Wednesday, on the eve of another visit by Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy aimed at stamping out the three-decades-long insurgency.\n",
      "Sarkozy, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper ahead of the Thursday trip, said he would continue his crackdown on those perpertrating daily bomb attacks against police stations and other buildings symbolising Paris's rule as well as what he called the \"mafia-like system\" of financing the attacks.\n",
      "He also held out the \"need for political dialogue, including with sincere nationalists\".\n",
      "But the various parties and groups calling for self-rule for the island have rejected the carrot-and-stick approach and organised a peaceful protest late Wednesday in front of the police station in the main city of Ajaccio to denounce Sarkozy's \"repressive\" policies.\n",
      "Attacks and vandalism have also increased, both on the island and on the French mainland.\n",
      "On Sunday night, a bomb was found in front of a police station in southern Corsica. The day before, a defused rocket was fired at police barracks in Ajaccio in a symbolic threat. A plaque commemorating two officers killed in the town of Aleria in 1975 was also destroyed.\n",
      "Those acts, and other recent ones against administrative buildings in Paris and the French Riviera city of Nice, have been claimed by one of the many undergound separatist militant factions, the Corsican National Liberation Front-Combattants' Union.\n",
      "The number of attacks has surged since July, when a referendum sponsored by Sarkozy that offered limited autonomy in exchange for an end to the violence was narrowly defeated by Corsica's wary 260,000 inhabitants.\n",
      "That was also the month French police arrested a high-profile separatist, Yvan Colonna, suspected of assassinating Corsica's governor in 1998.\n",
      "Both developments enraged the separatists, who have been a thorn in the side of successive French governments seeking to tame the island, which was the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n",
      "In his interview, Sarkozy said his security forces would \"give priority to going after criminal money -- the basis of the mafia-like system -- which is obtained from shake-downs, bombings and the underground economy.\"\n",
      "A nationalist leader who heads the Indipendenza party, Charles Pieri, was squarely in his sights, Sarkozy said, after information from investigators suggesting he was one of the most powerful figures defying Paris.\n",
      "The visit was to be Sarkozy's 10th to the island since he took up his functions last year. The minister has staked much of his reputation on finding a solution to the \"Corsican problem\".\n",
      "His last trip, October 16, was to underline his determination to force the separatists back into dialogue under the threat of increasingly tough security measures.\n",
      "His most notable act that time was to unveil a new plaque commemorating the spot in Ajaccio where the governor, Claude Erignac, was gunned down in 1998. The old plaque had been torn out of the wall in August.\n",
      "\"What matters is that each one of us realises that nothing, nowhere, ever justifies this .... This terrible past has shown us that violence is an impasse in which Corsica will lose its soul and fritter away the energy it needs so badly,\" Sarkozy said at the time.\n",

      "PARIS, Sept 4\n",
      "Fifteen people, including at least three  children, were killed and more than 30 injured in an apartment block  fire in a southern Paris suburb early Sunday -- the third fatal fire  to hit the French capital in nine days.\n",
      "The blaze broke out at around 1:00 am (2300 GMT Saturday) in the  hall of an 18-storey highrise containing 110 local authority flats  at L'Hay-les-Roses near Orly airport. The casualties -- including 11  who were seriously injured -- were all caused by smoke inhalation.\n",
      "Police said the origin of the fire appeared to be criminal, and  late afternoon they announced that three girls aged between 16 and  18, two of whom lived in the building, were being held for  questioning. Police said they did not yet have evidence linking the  girls to starting the fire.\n",
      "Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy told French television that  the fire was the result of a \"criminal act\" which needed to be  \"punished as such\".\n",
      "He rejected suggestions by the local mayor that the blaze  was  the consequence of an \"anti-social act.\"\n",
      "Residents told investigators that vandals had been spotted  setting light to letter-boxes on the ground floor of the highrise.  Low-level arson attacks on cars and property are a regular problem  in run-down housing estates that surround many French cities.\n",
      "Police raised the death toll from the fire to 15 on Sunday  evening.\n",
      "Altogether 39 people have been killed in three fires in Paris in  little over a week, but authorities were at pains to play down any  similarity between the latest disaster and the fires on August 26  and 29 which killed 24 African immigrants in two dilapidated Paris  buildings.\n",
      "\"This is a block of flats. It's got nothing to do with the fires  in the Paris squats,\" said fire service spokesman Michel Cros.\n",
      "Several African families were among the 500 people living in the  high-rise, which is in a working-class neighbourhood with no  particular reputation for trouble.\n",
      "The blaze sent long flames licking up the outside of the  building, while smoke billowed up the stairwell -- fanned by the  airflow as residents opened their doors in panic. On a hot night  most windows were open.\n",
      "Rescue workers found victims in the stairwell at the very top of  the building, while lower down residents who stayed in their  apartments and sealed their doors with material were safe.\n",
      "\"The smoke woke me. My bedroom was full of it. It stuck to the  skin, it was suffocating,\" said Jean, a first floor resident who  called the fire brigade. \"There were people who wanted to hurl  themselves from their windows, but I told them not to -- that the  emergency services were coming.\"\n",
      "\"There was total panic, because we saw the bodies of people we  knew. Our neighbours -- a couple and their child, an entire family  -- are dead,\" said Florence Leclerc.\n",
      "Some 160 fire-fighters were dispatched to the scene, and the  fire was brought under control after two hours. One young woman  resident gave birth in an ambulance brought to the scene.\n",
      "Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin issued a statement  expressing his \"condolences ... and the firm support of the state,\"  while Social Cohesion Minister Jean-Louis Borloo left a ruling party  conference at La Baule on the Atlantic coast to be at the scene.\n",
      "The question of safe and affordable housing for immigrants moved  to the top of the political agenda after the recent fires, which  followed an earlier conflagration in a city centre hotel in April  which killed 24 Africans.\n",
      "Police were working on the theory that one fire, which killed 17  Malians near Austerlitz station on August 26, may have been set  deliberately, but last Monday's at a squat in the fashionable Marais  district was almost certainly an accident.\n",
      "Both of those buildings were run-down condition and overcrowded,  and lacked safety equipment. By contrast the apartment bloc at  L'Hay-les-Roses appeared to have been properly maintained.\n",
      "Thousands of protesters marched through Paris on Saturday  demanding urgent investment in low-cost housing for immigrants, and  condemning the forced evacuation of two Paris squats late last  week.\n",
      "Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy ordered the evictions as a  safety measure, but the Socialist-controlled city council said no  long term alternative accommodation had been found for the 150  residents, many of whom are in France illegally.\n",
      "He told French television he took full responsibility for the  evictions and did not regret them.\n",

      "The people of Vienna have watched  open-mouthed in recent days as soldiers in British, French, Russian  and US uniforms have driven in jeeps along the streets of the  Austrian capital, in memory of the period from 1945 to 1955 when it  was divided into four Allied occupied zones.\n",
      "The reenactment is part of the country's celebration of its 60  years of independence, 50 years of sovereignty and 10 years as a  member of the European Union.\n",

      "\"What's the point of digging up the past? It's better to  concentrate on the present\".\n",
      "According to an opinion poll published in May, half of the  Austrian people do not want to hear any more discussion of World War  II and consider the issue closed.\n",
      "The poll also found that 41 percent of Austrians questioned said  they were \"unsure\" whether they considered the end of World War II  as a \"liberation\" or a \"military defeat\".\n",
      "The project highlighting the occupation is being staged all over  the country: the former occupied zones are also marked on all the  highways with banners saying \"You are leaving the US zone\" or \"You  are entering the French zone\".\n",
      "\"'How you feel today about the freedom which we enjoy?' This is  the question that we wanted to ask people, especially the young,\"  Wolfgang Lorenz, one of the project organisers told AFP.\n",
      "\" By recreating the former occupied zones, we want to remind  people that borders existed in some areas and that freedom is not  automatic.\"\n",
      "\"25 Peaces\" has raised controversy in Austria with historians  criticising its theatrical approach to history.\n",
      "However Lorenz emphasises that it is \"always good to open the  debate\" and that his activities in public areas allows him to reach  a young public who are often poorly informed about the history of  their country.\n",

      "Portugal's three most-watched evening  soap operas have introduced gay characters over the past year, a  move activists hope will change attitudes in the deeply Roman  Catholic country despite a conservative backlash.\n",
      "Gay characters have appeared on Portuguese television screens  before, mostly through imported Brazilian soaps which often stuck to  stereotypical portrayals.\n",
      "But this is the first time that top-rated, locally produced  television dramas have featured gays in recurrent and largely  sympathic roles.\n",
      "In the nation's most-watched show, \"No One Like You\", a subplot  revolves around a student's struggle to come to terms with his  sexuality and a crush on his supportive straight best friend.\n",
      "The daily show, which regularly draws over 1.4 million viewers  and manages to beat broadcasts of football matches in the ratings,  also features an older, openly gay character whose sexuality is  accepted by his family and friends.\n",
      "The youth-oriented soap \"Strawberries With Sugar\" meanwhile  features a young lesbian who comfortably explores her sexuality  while a key subplot in \"My World\" concerns a young man who is in a  relationship with a woman despite his growing doubts over his sexual  orientation.\n",
      "All three shows air on television channel TVI. The station,  controlled by the powerful Roman Catholic Church when it began  broadcasting in 1993, has adopted more daring programming -- and led  prime-time ratings -- since falling into private hands five years  later.\n",
      "While the main aim of producers of the series is to entertain,  they say they also hope the introduction of gay characters will help  educate the public.\n",
      "\"There was a natural tendency to try to break some social  restrictions around the subject,\" the head writer of \"Strawberries  With Sugar,\" Ines Gomes, told AFP.\n",
      "Portuguese society is one of western Europe's most socially  conservative, a legacy of a right-wing dictatorship that ruled the  country until 1974, and it has been slow to accept gay rights.\n",
      "While neighbouring Spain legalized gay marriage in June, the  issue is not even on the political agenda in Portugal although  same-sex couples have since 2001 enjoyed the same tax benefits and  some rights of common law couples.\n",
      "There are no openly gay politicians or television personalities  in the country of just over 10 million and opinion polls show it is  one of the most hostile nations in the European Union towards gay  marriage and child adoptions by gays.\n",
      "Paulo Corte-Real, a representative of Portugal's chapter of the  International Association of Gays and Lesbians (ILGA), said positive  depictions of gays in popular culture could help foster greater  acceptance.\n",
      "\"Traditionally fiction pushed gays into the closet, it was a  topic only discussed in marginal movies and plays with low ratings.  It's very important that more popular series show that gays and  lesbians exist,\" he told AFP.\n",
      "But not everyone is happy to see gays step out of the closet and  into their living rooms.\n",
      "Portugese fado singer Goncalo da Camara Pereira, known for his  conservative views, sparked controversy in July when he accused TVI  of seeking to \"promote\" homosexuality, which he called a \"proven  psychological disease\".\n",
      "\"In the past gays were discreet, then they started to be open  and someday it will be obligatory,\" he told daily newspaper  24Horas.\n",
      "The far-right National Front meanwhile is collecting signatures  on a petition urging Portugal's television watchdog to ban a  yet-to-debut reality show where style-challenged straight men will  get a makeover by five experts whose credentials include being gay.\n",
      "The minor fringe group is organizing a march in the Portuguese  capital for September 17 against the show, to air on private  television Sic, and the \"gay and paedophile lobby\".\n",

      "DUBLIN, Sept 20, 2005\n",
      "A Sinn Fein campaign for Irish  unity was strongly attacked on Tuesday by Justice Minister Michael  McDowell who described it as a betrayal of republicanism that was  designed to induce a state of fear in Protestant Unionists in  Northern Ireland.\n",
      "Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, is  staging rallies aimed at getting the Irish government to initiate a  process and bring forward a green paper discussion paper on  unification of the two parts of the island.\n",
      "McDowell, who is a member of the Progressive Democrats junior  partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, says that  under the Good Friday peace deal Irish unity is subject \"to the  agreement and consent\" of a majority of the people of Northern  Ireland.\n",
      "He said \"putting the aggressive and futile pursuit of political  unification\" before the immediate imperative of beginning the  process of reconciling the two communities is a \"betrayal of the  values and vision\" of genuine Irish republicanism.\n",
      "\"Put bluntly, 'making partition history' is a recipe for civil  war and sectarian strife unless it is preceded by a sustained and  successful campaign of 'making sectarianism and social and political  segregation history'.\n",
      "\"It is nothing less than an attempt to induce a state of crisis  and fear in the hearts of those who should, instead, be the focus of  the project of reconciliation.\"\n",
      "He said no-one has a mandate from history to to polarise, to  segregate, or to subjugate any community in Ireland in the name of  the Irish republic.\n",
      "\"If, as we do, the people of this state aspire to unite the  island and people of Ireland in a shared political future, there is  only one way to achieve that goal which is to follow the path of  reconciliation - not the path of subjugation.\"\n",
      "McDowell said reconciling the island's two communities,  represented by the orange and green in the Irish flag, is not for  the faint-hearted, not for the rabble-rouser, not for avengers, and  not for hate-mongers.\n",
      "\"Reconciliation is a vocation that calls for civic virtues that  are not to be found in the actions, words, tactics and strategies of  the Provisional (Sinn Fein/IRA) movement,\" he said.\n",

      "The Greek conservative government came  under concerted fire on Thursday over a planned law which accords  university status to Orthodox seminary schools, a move which the  press condemned as \"anachronistic\" and \"theocratic.\"\n",
      "The new bill by the ministry of education, which has political  responsibility over affairs of religion in Greece, elevates the four  male-only church academies that train Orthodox priests to university  status, raising the prospect of higher salaries for clergy  graduates.\n",
      "\"There is no need for such universities,\" the authoritative,  pro-government Kathimerini daily commented in an editorial,  labelling the whole initiative \"an anachronistic paradox\" at a time  when Greece's other state universities are perenially short of  cash.\n",
      "\"Ayatollah universities\", read the derisive headline of  centre-left Eleftherotypia daily, a frequent critic of the church.\n",
      "The planned law also brewed a storm of protest from the  opposition parties of the left and centre, who accused the ruling  conservatives of making concessions to the Greek Orthodox Church, an  influential power in a country where around 98 percent of the  population are avowed Orthodox believers.\n",
      "Theologians also bristled at the perceived threat to their  influence, with the rector of Athens University's theology  department, Father Metallinos, arguing that the reform \"is directed  against free theological thought.\"\n",

      "The ultimate cost of the upgrade on the state budget, involving  an expanded curriculum and additional staff salaries, will be up to  3.5 million euros (4.3 million dollars) over several years, the  education ministry said.\n",

      "Security forces moved in early  Saturday to end blockades by strikers at the Corsican port of  Ajaccio and two oil terminals in Marseille, amid a bitter dispute  over the privatisation of a state-owned ferry company.\n",
      "\"Our objective is to allow free movement of traffic in the port  of Ajaccio, initially to allow the very large number of tourists  stuck in Corsica to leave,\" the island's chief administrator,  Pierre-Rene Lemas, said.\n",
      "\"There are almost 15,000 people stuck in Corsica, including  women and children, who we are urgently trying to house,\" Lemas told  reporters.\n",
      "Backed by two armoured vehicles, around 150 riot and  paramilitary police removed the trucks and dustbins that blocked the  access ramp to the only ship in Ajaccio, according to an AFP  reporter at the scene.\n",
      "There was no resistance from 15 or so strikers from the National  Corsica Mediterranean Company (SNCM) who have picketed the site  since four leaders of the pro-nationalist Union of Corsican Workers  (STC) were arrested on Wednesday after hijacking an SNCM ship.\n",
      "The four were released late Friday in a possible sign of  appeasement to demonstrators who had thronged the streets of  Ajaccio.\n",

      "However, officials in the port of Bastia said one ship remained  blocked there.\n",
      "In the southern mainland port of Marseille, security forces also  ended a blockade of two oil terminals by workers striking in  sympathy with the SNCM employees, officials said.\n",
      "\"The operation took place at 6:30 am without incident,\" the  local administration said in a statement. \"The entrances will be  guarded to ensure free movement.\"\n",
      "Marseille dock workers immediately announced a strike Saturday  to demand the removal of the security forces from the port.\n",
      "The 11-day old labour dispute over government plans to sell-off  the debt-ridden SNCM ferry company has taken on dangerous  nationalist overtones on Corsica, an island that has been prey to  separatist violence for some 30 years.\n",
      "In the biggest crisis to hit his four-month old administration,  Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has been trying to negotiate  the sale of the SNCM to private investment firm Butler Capital  Partners -- provoking outrage from a strongly militant labour  force.\n",
      "Plagued by huge debts, regular strikes and growing competition  from cheaper private operators, the SNCM faces imminent bankruptcy  unless it finds an outside buyer. The government is banned by EU  rules from bailing it out yet again.\n",
      "In a gesture to the strikers Thursday, Villepin suggested a new  sell-off deal under which the state would keep 25 percent of the  company. Butler would take over 70 percent and later sell 30 percent  to Connex, the transport subsidiary of French utilities services  group Veolia Environnement.\n",
      "SNCM workers would control the remaining five percent of the  stock. But unions said the offer did not go far enough.\n",

      "The situation was worse in other cities such as Marseille and  Bordeaux, where most public transport was out of action.\n",
      "There were delays of up to two hours at Paris's two airports and  nearly 400 short and medium haul flights were cancelled. No  disruptions were reported on long-haul flights.\n",
      "The SNCF national rail company said that 40 percent of regional  services were up and running as well as 60 percent of high-speed TGV  intercity lines.\n",
      "Some hospital staff and government office workers were also on  strike, but the private sector appeared mainly unaffected. Most  national newspapers failed to go on sale because of action by  print-workers.\n",
      "Five of the country's biggest trade unions called the stoppage  to protest against the cautious reform policies of Villepin's  centre-right government and to push for pay rises.\n",
      "Their main target was a new labour contract -- introduced  recently by government decree -- which makes it easier for companies  with fewer than 20 staff to hire and fire workers in their first two  years of employment.\n",
      "The unions have been backed by a rare show of unity from the  country's left and far-left parties, still smarting from their  bitter internecine rift over the EU constitution which was rejected  in a referendum in May.\n",
      "The Socialist, Green, Communist and Communist Revolutionary  League parties said in a statement that action was necessary \"to  break with the reactionary and ultra-liberal (economic) logic of the  government.\"\n",
      "The strike came at a sensitive time for Villepin, who has been  rocked onto the back foot by a crisis over the privatisation of the  National Corsica Mediterranean Company (SNCM) which serves Corsica  and north Africa from ports on the Mediterranean coast.\n",
      "Plans to sell off the heavily-indebted concern sparked days of  violence in Corsica, a near-blockade of the island, and the  shut-down of the France's largest port of Marseille. Though action  was taken over the weekend to re-open communications, the situation  remained highly volatile.\n",
      "A loyal ally of President Jacques Chirac who was appointed after  the May referndum debacle, Villepin, 51, has won cautious praise for  his first four months in office.\n",
      "He has been rewarded with a gradual fall in the number of  jobless to under ten percent of the workforce, while last week saw  his poll ratings overtake for the first time those of Interior  Minister Nicolas Sarkozy -- the radical rightwinger who is also a  likely challenger in France's 2007 presidential race.\n",

      "EDF workers protest part-privatisation by Marc Burleigh = (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - UPDATES with small protests, Villepin quotes ///\n",
      "PARIS, Oct 25\n",
      "Workers at France's EDF electricity  utility were preparing on Tuesday a campaign of protests against  government plans to sell off part of the huge company, which Prime  Minister Dominique de Villepin defended as being \"in the nation's  interest\".\n",
      "The powerful CGT and FO unions declared their EDF members would  begin hardline action from November 8 which would include strikes  and targeted electricity cuts. A big Paris demonstration is also  scheduled for November 19.\n",
      "On Tuesday, small knots of EDF workers gathered in front of  government offices across the country to show their opposition to  the privatisation, which entails up to 15 percent of the state-owned  utility being sold off to raise around seven billion euros (8.4  billion dollars).\n",
      "A union delegation handed a petition with 100,000 signatures  denouncing the flotation to the government and calling for a public  debate on EDF's future.\n",
      "But Villepin, who announced the sell-off Monday, defended the  move as \"a good decision for all of France because we have entered a  post-oil period.\"\n",
      "High oil prices -- currently hovering around 60 dollars a barrel  -- and rising energy demands \"mean that we need additional  investment that has to be financed,\" he told parliament.\n",
      "EDF chief executive, Pierre Gadonneix, has said the company  would invest 40 billion euros (48 billion dollars) over five years  to boost electricity production, mainly in France, and to pay for  more acquisitions abroad.\n",
      "The launch of the EDF share offer is to take place Friday, with  trading to begin by November 21, Economy Minister Thierry Breton  said.\n",
      "The operation would value EDF at around 50 billion euros, with  the shares expected to be set at 24.40 euros each at least.\n",
      "Workers at the utility have been allocated 15 percent of the  issue, while institutional investors will get 50 percent and private  investors 35 percent.\n",
      "The flotation -- one of the biggest in Europe -- has been on the  cards for some time, as the government repositions EDF to cope with  competition in the energy sector brought in by EU rules.\n",
      "EDF, Europe's biggest utility and the largest supplier of  civilian nuclear energy in the world, has been aggressively  expanding internationally in recent years, racking up nearly 20  billion euros in debt.\n",
      "The company generates nearly three-quarters of its output in  France from nuclear power plants, of which 19 dot the country, and  it supplies 22 percent of the European Union's energy needs.\n",
      "Unions, though, accuse Villepin's conservative government of  forcing through privatisation over the concerns of workers, who fear  job losses and a decline in the public service role of the big  enterprises.\n",
      "\"Job-cuts will likely happen. The reassurances of the government  and the management on this subject are only there to help us swallow  the medicine,\" one EDF technician, Hubert Hamon, told Le Parisien  newspaper.\n",
      "Villepin sought to attentuate some of the fears by having his  government sign a contract with EDF which he said would ensure  moderate and universal electricity rates would stay, and poorer  families would not find themselves suddenly cut off if unable to pay  their energy bills.\n",
      "The leader of the opposition Socialists, Francois Hollande, said  he would reverse the privatisation if his party came to power in  2007 elections by having the state buy up the shares issued.\n",
      "Future financing of EDF and other state-owned enterprises would  then be funded through \"a public financing company that would raise  capital on the markets,\" he said.\n",

      "The protestors \"took to the streets to fight against the  irrational fears which have cut by half the consumption of poultry,\"  the statement said.\n",
      "The union's president, Paolo Bedoni, urged the government to  launch an information campaign to counter alarmist views \"which lead  to emotional negative reactions.\"\n",
      "The consumption of chicken has fallen by between 20 to 50  percent throughout Italy, and in some regions the decline has been  as much as 60 percent, according to union estimates.\n",
      "Another union, the Italian confederation of agriculture,  estimated the drop in poultry sales at 350 million euros (423  million dollars) as a result of the bird flu \"panic\".\n",
      "The national union of poultry farmers has asked the government  to declare that the poultry sector \"in a state of crisis\" and asked  for financial help.\n",
      "The Italian poultry sector with annual sales of 4 billion euros  is comprised of some 6,100 breeders who employ about 80,000 people,  according to union figures.\n",

      "There were no reports of civilian casualties but six police  officers were slightly injured.\n",
      "As with the previous nights of rioting, the violence dissipated  before dawn and the suburb was calm during the day Monday.\n",
      "The unrest was originally triggered when two teenagers, aged 15  and 17, died by electrocution on Thursday after they scaled the wall  of an electrical relay station and touched a transformer.\n",
      "Molins said the boys thought they were being chased by police,  but authorities have denied that was the case.\n",

      "A lawyer representing the families of the victims, Jean-Pierre  Mignard, asked: \"Why did these young people, who had done nothing  wrong, feel sufficiently threatened to enter a dangerous site, climb  over a 2.5-metre (six foot) barbed-wire covered wall and hide inside  a turbine?\"\n",
      "The clashes have pitted youths -- at times several hundred of  them -- against police, leaving a total of 23 officers injured.\n",

      "Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that the grenade was  of the type used by riot squads, but said \"that does not mean that  it was fired by a police officer.\"\n",
      "An inquiry was underway into the incident, he said, adding that  he would speak with the mosque's imam, or prayer leader.\n",
      "The families of the victims on Monday turned down an invitation  to meet Sarkozy, and slammed the reported teargas incident as  \"disrespectful\".\n",
      "\"We are asking for calm, we are asking for justice and we are  asking for the riot police to leave,\" Siyakah Traore, brother of one  of the victims, told a press conference at the mosque.\n",

      "Opposition and rights campaigners said the riots were fuelled by  tough new French anti-crime policies espoused by Sarkozy, who vowed  to wage a \"war without mercy\" on crime in the Paris suburbs just a  week before the rampages.\n",
      "Sarkozy repeated on Monday that he was \"totally determined\" to  combat the violence.\n",

      "\"If it's proven to reduce suffering through animal tests, it's  not wrong to use them. To say cosmetics is an absolute evil is  absurd.\"\n",

      "Work on the 20-million-pound (29-million-euro,  35-million-dollar) project was halted in July 2004 when contractors  pulled out due to a sustained protest campaign. Construction resumed  under strict security late last year.\n",
      "Pro-vivisectionists and fellow scientists quoted by The Guardian  appeared to distance themselves from Aziz's remarks on cosmetic  testing using animals, which was banned in Britain in 1998, saying  it was his personal opinion.\n",

      "A petition launched by the  far-right party FPOe in Austria against the European Union and  Turkey's adhesion to the block will now be debated in parliament  after receiving support from 4.28 percent of the electorate.\n",
      "The \"Austria, stay free\" petition, which was launched on March 6  and closed late Monday, gathered 258,277 signatures, the Interior  Ministry said.\n",
      "While political opponents called it a flop, FPOe leader  Heinz-Christian Strache -- successor and young rival of Jorg Haider  -- said it was an \"awesome success\" and praised \"brave and  courageous Austrians\" who supported the petition despite  \"unfavourable conditions\" on national television late Monday.\n",
      "Strache added that the petition, which needed 100,000 signatures  out of 6 million voters to be taken to parliament, reached its  target, even doubling expectations.\n",
      "But although MPs are now obliged to debate the initiative, they  do not have to order a referendum.\n",
      "At a press conference Tuesday, Strache criticised this process,  saying the law should be amended so that a referendum is  automatically held if a petition gathers 250,000 signatures.\n",
      "\"More than a million people are with us in spirit,\" Strache  said, arguing pressure was applied on those who worked in businesses  that were conservative or Social Democrat, and that because of  weather conditions, many were not informed where they could sign the  initiative.\n",
      "Among the main issues raised in the petition were the need to  maintain Austrian neutrality and opposition to the European  constitution and Turkey's accession to the EU.\n",
      "Reinhold Lopatka, general secretary of the conservative OeVP  called the petition \"unnecessary and expensive\" late Monday, arguing  it would cost taxpayers two million euros (2.4 million dollars).\n",
      "Social Democrat (SPOe) leader Josef Cap described it as \"an  unnecessary petition with mediocre results,\" adding the provisions  it demanded were already in place.\n",
      "But political scientist Anton Pelinka, cited by the daily Der  Standard Tuesday, said the lef was partly to blame: \"On the Turkish  question, the SPOe played on populism as much as the FPOe,\" he  said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, BZOe speaker Uwe Scheuch said it was \"a clear  failure\" and Green deputy spokeswoman Eva Glawischnig \"a flop.\"\n",
      "Xenophobia and anti-European sentiment played a main role in the  campaign.   According to the latest Eurobarometer figures, only 32  percent of Austrians believe the EU is a good thing.\n",
      "Strache is also strongly opposed to Turkey joining the EU, like  80 percent of Austrians, compared to an EU average of 39 percent,  according to the latest Eurobaromater figures.\n",
      "Strache used the recent debate over cartoons of the prophet  Mohammed to target a so-called \"Muslim threat\" and also warned that  Austria would have to give up its neutrality if the EU set up a  European security framework.\n",
      "The petition was less successful than two previous neutrality  initiatives in 1996 and 1997 and just slightly better than one  conducted in 2000.\n",
      "Of Austria's nine provinces, Vienna provided the most signatures  with 58,551, or 5.24 percent of the electorate supporting the  initiative.\n",
      "Carinthia, home to former FPOe leader and Strache-rival Joerg  Haider and his new BZOe party, had the poorest showing with only  8,166 signatures, or 1,91 percent of voters.\n",
      "Analysts have said the initiative would not bring practical  results but could help FPOe gather media attention ahead of  Austria's general elections towards the end of the year, as the  split far-right camp has lost considerable ground in recent regional  elections.\n",

      "Ben Griffin will join established opponents of the US-led  invasion of March 20, 2003, plus family members of some of the 103  British service personnel who have been killed in the Gulf, the Stop  the War Coalition said.\n",
      "The 28-year-old, who detailed his reasons for quitting the elite  22 Special Air Service to a British newspaper last Sunday, expanded  on his comments Thursday, calling on Britain to pull out its 8,000  troops immediately.\n",
      "\"Britain has let itself down by following America into this war.  They should withdraw from the coalition immediately,\" he told a  London news conference ahead of the protest Saturday in the British  capital.\n",
      "Griffin, who in his two years in the SAS served in Iraq,  Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and Macedonia, told his commanding  officer of his moral objections last year and was discharged with an  exemplary service record.\n",
      "Since publicly voicing his reasons for quitting, he said he had  received messages of support from serving British officers, many  agreeing with his view that the war was illegal, and sharing his  concern at Britain's perceived lack of influence over US policy in  Iraq.\n",
      "\"I think there is a growing feeling in the British Army of  disappointment that we're out there and that they feel let down by  the government,\" he said, stressing he had not signed up \"to conduct  US foreign policy\".\n",
      "Griffin, from London, said he was concerned before being posted  to Iraq about the legality of the war and its justification that  former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass  destruction, but followed orders and went.\n",
      "\"The conduct of the war, I thought, was wrong. A lot of things  were going wrong out there,\" he explained.\n",
      "\"My views became clearer and stronger while I was serving out  there until I reached a point when I found I couldn't separate those  views from my job.\"\n",
      "Most were linked to the attitude and actions of US forces, whom  he said \"failed to grasp\" the difference between combat and  counter-insurgency operations after the end of formal hostilities.\n",
      "They made little effort to minimise civilian casualties, did  not respect rules of engagement to fire only as a last resort and  treated the Iraqi people with contempt, he claimed.\n",
      "They also ignored British advice, gained through harsh  experience in Northern Ireland, about not being heavy-handed, all of  which had led to the coalition, and specifically the United States,  losing Iraqi consent, the soldier stated.\n",
      "\"If you lose the consent of the Iraqi people, there's no way  this is going to be resolved until the US and Britain get out of  Iraq,\" he said.\n",
      "Lindsey German, convenor of the Stop the War Coalition, told AFP  she expected up to 100,000 people at the demonstration, which  coincides with others around the world, including in Iraq.\n",

      "\"Violence is the only way of making yourself heard,\" said  Baptiste, a youth from a Paris suburb observing the demonstration.  \"If (the government) wants to have a go at us, we'll have a go  back.\"\n",

      "Protests against the government's contested First Employment  Contract (CPE) have repeatedly turned violent, but the government  said the youth-dominated demonstrations and marches had been  dwindling since the first major shows of force earlier this month.\n",
      "The disturbances came as Villepin's government began to give  first hints of conciliation in the crisis, with the premier  preparing to hold open-agenda talks with the main trade unions on  Friday.\n",
      "In a letter Villepin promised that the agenda of the talks would  be \"completely open,\" and in their reply the unions said they  \"reaffirm their demand for the CPE to be withdrawn before we agree  to dialogue or negotiation on employment, job insecurity and the  future of the youth.\"\n",

      "The prime minister has come under growing criticism -- even from  within his ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) -- for failing  to respond to the growing campaign of popular opposition, and  Thursday's initiative was the first sign of a search for a  compromise.\n",
      "An open-ended contract that can be terminated within the first  two years without justification, the CPE was conceived by Villepin  as a tool against France's high youth unemployment rate which is can  reach more than 50 percent in the high-immigration suburbs hit by  last year's riots.\n",
      "But it is opposed by an alliance of students, unions and  left-wing political parties, who see it as a breach in France's  hard-won system of employee protection. They have been demanding its  complete withdrawal as a precondition for ending their protests.\n",
      "A day of nationwide strikes and more demonstrations is planned  for Tuesday.\n",
      "The measure was voted through parliament two weeks ago as part  of a wider equal opportunities law, and is now awaiting approval  from the Constitutional Council -- the body that rules on the  constitutionality of laws -- before coming into force.\n",
      "Villepin, 52, who was appointed by President Jacques Chirac 10  months ago, has staked his political future on implementing the CPE,  and it was still unclear how much he would be willing to  compromise.\n",

      "BRUSSELS, March 24, 2006\n",
      "French President Jacques Chirac  defended Friday his eye-brow-raising exit from an EU summit session,  accusing the French head of Europe's employer union of piquing  French pride by daring to speak in English.\n",
      "An ardent defender of the French tongue, Chirac said he had been  \"deeply shocked\" to hear English on the lips of the Frenchman in a  speech at the two-day European summit.\n",
      "\"I was deeply shocked that a Frenchman would speak at the  council table in English,\" he told journalists, explaining for the  first time his abrupt walkout when the summit opened on Thursday.\n",
      "\"That's the reason why the French delegation and myself left so  as not to have to listen to that,\" he added.\n",
      "Chirac's surprise exit was one of the few incidents to spice up  an otherwise staid summit focused on agreeing a joint EU energy  strategy and reviving the bloc's economy.\n",
      "When Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of the UNICE employers  federation, started his speech to the EU's 25 leaders, Chirac  interrupted and asked why he was speaking in English, according to a  French official.\n",
      "\"I'm going to speak in English because that is the language of  business,\" replied Seilliere, former chief of the French employers'  group MEDEF, which has been at odds with the government recently.\n",

      "Chirac, 73, and his ministers returned only after Seilliere  finished his address.\n",
      "Other European leaders shrugged off Chirac's attempt to defend  French pride.\n",
      "\"Europe has other worries and it's a waste of time to have  responded to such questions,\" said Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker, who is usually a stout francophile.\n",
      "Taking a shot at Seilliere, he added: \"I cannot cease to be  amazed that while our French friends invite us to speak French many  of their top officials not in government are more than happy to  speak in approximative English\".\n",
      "British Prime Minister Tony Blair, claiming not to have noticed  Chirac's departure, tried to strike a light note about the incident,  saying with a smile: \"People do get up and go for all sorts of  reasons.\"\n",
      "To the consternation of Paris, English has overtaken French as  the European Union's lingua franca, especially since it welcomed 10  new member states, mostly former Soviet communist bloc states in  eastern Europe, in May 2004.\n",
      "French speakers regularly complain that official documents  increasingly appear in English and only later in French, which is  along with German an official language for EU institutions.\n",
      "Although English, French and German are the official languages  of the EU institutions, by tradition EU leaders speak in their own  language at summits through simultaneous interpretation.\n",
      "Rubbing salt into the wounds Seilliere inflicted on French  pride, the Brussels correspondent for Britain's eurosceptic Sun  newspaper, Michael Lea,  approached Chirac at the end of Friday's  news conference with a small English-language phrase book for  tourists.\n",
      "\"This is a present from your friends at The Sun,\" Lea told the  French leader, who first looked puzzled, then smiled as he slipped  the little tome into his pocket.\n",

      "Friends and family paid their respects to Joe Van Holsbeeck, 17,  who was stabbed to death by two young men trying to steal his MP3  player as he waited for friends at the Gare Centrale in Brussels.\n",
      "The brutal killing has sparked a wave of grief and anger in  Belgium, with politicians lining up to condemn the murder and local  press giving it extensive coverage.\n",
      "About 50 fellow boy scouts attended the funeral in the youth's  hometown of Haren, on the outskirts of Brussels, and six of them  bore their friend's casket into the church for the ceremony.\n",
      "\"We are all in shock at the brutal death of Joe,\" the parish  priest said, his voice breaking with emotion.\n",
      "At the family's request, politicians stayed away from the  ceremony. Some public figures, such as the royal couple, chose to  pay their respects with floral bouquets.\n",
      "The killers are still at large and police have circulated  photo-fits in the hope of tracking them down.\n",

      "But, Szabados added, people are exhausted from events over the  past week \"and most will stay at home\".\n",

      "Gyurcsany's popularity had slumped even before the protests  erupted, after he introduced harsh economic reforms that include tax  increases in order to rein in a skyrocketing deficit -- the highest  in the European Union at more than 10 percent of gross domestic  product.\n",
      "In interviews published Friday in the foreign press, Gyurcsany  said his taped comments had been misinterpreted and argued that he  still enjoyed the support of the Hungarian people.\n",

      "RIGA, Sept 7, 2006\n",
      "Latvian lawmakers on Thursday  rejected a bill proposed by a populist party to ban what it called  \"homosexual propaganda\" in the mass media.\n",
      "The Latvia First Party had prepared draft amendments to media  and advertising laws, which would have made it illegal to publish  articles about or interviews with gays and lesbians, in which they  talk about their lives or gay rights.\n",
      "The changes were necessary to \"ensure that the mass media do not  weaken the role of the family institution, do not split society, and  do not create a misconception about a group of individuals claiming  special treatment due to their beliefs,\" the party said in a  statement.\n",
      "Media analyst Anda Rozukalne said the proposed amendments went  against Latvian and international law, and speculated the Latvia  First Party was trying to tap into homophobia in the Baltic state  which it saw as a vote catcher ahead of next month's general  elections.\n",
      "\"Latvia First believes that homophobia is a mother lode that  will help them to attract more voters,\" Rozukalne told AFP.\n",
      "\"It was clear that the Latvian parliament would reject the  proposal, which goes against national and international legislation,  and against common sense. But it is sad that we have parties, which  can come up with such absurd, impudent and homophobic proposals,\"  Rozukalne said.\n",
      "Latvia First has 13 seats in the 100-strong parliament.\n",
      "Interior Minister Dzintars Jaundzeikars, of Latvia First,  succeeded in July in convincing Riga City Council to ban what would  have been Latvia's second gay pride parade, citing alleged threats  to security.\n",
      "Latvian gays and lesbians along with supporters from the  European Union and the United States staged alternative gay pride  events, during which they were verbally abused and pelted with eggs  and excrement by anti-gay groups.\n",

      "Tens of thousands of  people, led by Prime Minister Tony Blair's sister-in-law, held a  march Saturday on the eve of the ruling Labour Party's conference in  protest at British policy over Iraq, Afghanistan and Israel.\n",
      "Organisers, who billed the event as the largest ever lobby of a  political party in Britain, claimed between 50,000 and 60,000 people  attended.\n",
      "But police in Manchester, north-west England, the venue for both  convention and march, were more conservative in their estimates,  putting the number at about 10,000.\n",
      "Labour's conference will be embattled Blair's last as leader and  prime minister before he steps down next year.\n",
      "Lauren Booth, the half-sister of Blair's wife Cherie, led the  protest with notable left-wingers and the firebrand lawmaker George  Galloway, who was ousted by Labour because of his opposition to the  conflict in Iraq.\n",
      "Others included Michael Meacher -- a former environment minister  in Blair's government -- Muslim groups, unions and the families of  some of the 115 British troops who have been killed in Iraq since  the conflict began in March 2003.\n",
      "They also attacked Blair over cuts and privatisation in the  public health service and the revival of Britain's mothballed  nuclear energy programme and called for the country's Trident  submarine nuclear deterrent to be scrapped.\n",
      "Booth, a journalist and commentator, told the crowds: \"By chance  of marriage, I'm related to Tony Blair, a fact that makes neither of  us very happy today, I can tell you that.\"\n",
      "She denied that she wanted to embarrass him, saying she wanted  to make him feel \"ashamed\" over deaths of civilians in Iraq and  Afghanistan and that he did not call for a ceasefire during the  recent conflict in Lebanon sooner.\n",
      "Earlier, Booth told reporters Blair's foreign policy overall had  been \"calamitous\", while he had been \"a disaster\" in the Middle  East.\n",
      "Drums, whistles and chants rang out around the heavily-policed  route in Manchester, which in the 19th century was a hotbed for the  trade union activism that led to Labour's creation.\n",
      "Protestors called for Blair to resign immediately or be  impeached over his role justifying military action in Iraq.\n",
      "In the crowd was retired British airman Christopher Rydon, 71,  who accused Blair of tarnishing the reputation of Britain's armed  services, with which he served for 12 years.\n",
      "On Iraq and Afghanistan, he told AFP: \"We've no business in  these wars at all. It was based on lies. It's been proved to be lies  and he's spoiled our good name,\" he added.\n",
      "Lindsey German, convenor of the mainly left-wing Stop the War  Coalition, which co-organised the event, warned there would be no  let-up in the protests if finance minister Gordon Brown, bookies'  favourite to succeed Blair, takes over.\n",
      "\"Gordon Brown needn't think he's getting an easy ride of it...  Anybody who takes over had better change their policy or we're back  on the streets again,\" she said.\n",

      "The government has introduced a much tougher line on immigration  and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy has vowed to step up the pace  of deportations of illegal immigrants to 25,000 this year.\n",
      "Parliament approved a new law in June which seeks to encourage  more qualified workers to come to France but tightens entrance rules  for other foreigners, in particular for immigrants' families.\n",
      "It also scraps the automatic right to residency papers for  illegal immigrants who have been in the country for at least 10  years.\n",

      "The protesters left the scene around an hour afterwards in order  to find where the three were being held and handed to authorities a  list of all protestors in what they described as a gesture of  solidarity.\n",
      "The protestors \"are ready to assume responsibility for their  actions, including in court and including in the face of proceedings  which could be serious,\" Bove told reporters. \"I act with my face  uncovered, I take responsibility for my actions.\"\n",
      "Bove, a leading figure within the anti-globalisation movement  who in the past has been imprisoned for similar actions, said the  crops were indeed genetically modified.\n",
      "\"We covered more than 400 hectares (990 acres) across the whole  of the southwest to determine whether they were GM. Here, we were  able to verify it,\" he said.\n",

      "Greenpeace militants had also targeted the same field in July,  marking a cross in the centre of a 30-metre (100-feet) circle,  leading to the arrest of six activists from the ecological  organisation, who were subsequently released.\n",
      "The farmer concerned, Claude Menara, sued Greenpeace and forced  it in the same month to remove from its website a map showing GM  maize fields.\n",

      "Embattled Hungarian Prime  Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany is set to receive a boost on Tuesday from  the European Commission, which is expected to back austerity  measures at the centre of anti-government protests here.\n",
      "The multi-billion-euro austerity package, which seeks to slash  the public deficit from 10.1 percent of gross domestic product this  year to 3.2 percent in 2009, is part of the country's so-called  convergence plan to meet eurozone criteria between 2011 and 2013.\n",
      "An EU source told AFP on condition of anonymity on Monday that  the plan would get the green light from Brussels after an earlier  version was rejected in January for its lack of credibility.\n",
      "Hungary has been in political turmoil since September 17, when  it was revealed that Gyurcsany lied about the dire state of the  economy in order to win re-election in April.\n",
      "After campaigning on a platform of tax cuts and higher social  spending, Gyurcsany forced the austerity package -- which calls for  tax rises, mass public sector layoffs and energy price subsidy cuts  -- through parliament in June.\n",
      "The package counts on savings of 350 billion forint (1.27  billion euros, 1.62 billion dollars) this year and of 1.0 trillion  forint in 2007.\n",
      "Conservative opposition leader Viktor Orban wants to make  municipal elections on Sunday a referendum on Gyurcsany and his  package, saying the Socialists had no mandate to pass the austerity  measures.\n",
      "But Gyurcsany has been adamant the measures are necessary to  rein in the deficit and stabilize the economy, which analysts have  warned could go into a tailspin if the austerity package is diluted  or withdrawn.\n",
      "Gyurcsany has refused to resign, saying the outcome of the local  elections, which are dominated by candidates with no party  affiliation and are likely to be inconclusive, would not derail his  economic policies.\n",
      "Since he admitted to lying, far-right protests have taken place  daily in front of the Hungarian parliament, but they appear to be  losing steam.\n",
      "On Monday evening, only about 6,000 demonstrators were out  calling for Gyurcsany to quit, down from some 8,000 on Sunday night  and 20,000 on Saturday.\n",
      "The protests degenerated into street riots early last week,  leaving some 250 injured in the worst street violence the country  has seen since the end of communism.\n",
      "Gyurcsany has criticized Orban for allying his party with the  protestors, who are calling not only for the prime minister's  resignation but also for the overthrow of democracy.\n",

      "Watercolours thought to have been  painted by Adolf Hitler auctioned for twice their estimated price on  Tuesday after a well-known comedy protestor gatecrashed the sale.\n",
      "The collection of 21 paintings was found in Belgium in an attic  close to where the Nazi dictator served during the First World War,  and sold for 118,000 pounds (223,500 dollars, 176,000 euros).\n",
      "It had been expected to attract bids up to 50,000 pounds in the  auction run by Jefferys Auctioneers in Lostwithiel, southwest  England.\n",
      "Many of the paintings, which were mostly landscapes, were signed  \"A Hitler\", while others \"AH\". There were also two books about  Hitler included.\n",
      "The single most expensive item sold was a watercolour of \"The  Church of Preux-Au-Bois\", which sold for 10,500 pounds -- it had  been estimated at between 2,500 and 3,500 pounds.\n",
      "One of the buyers, who gave his name as Carlo and was from  Estonia, said he was working for an eastern European businessman and  had a \"budget to bid for anything that has Hitler's signature.\"\n",
      "\"I think they are probably being bought for business -- the  paintings are not very good and it's not nice to have a 'Hitler' on  your living room wall.\"\n",
      "The comedy protestor, Aaron Barschak, gained instant notoriety  in 2003 when he evaded security at Prince William's birthday bash at  Windsor Castle, climbed on stage dressed as Osama bin Laden, and  kissed the prince on both cheeks as he addressed guests.\n",

      "Barschak and his companion, who said he was called Frank Sanazi,  shouted they were bidding \"six million because the painting was a  Mussolini\" before security guards dragged them away with Barschak  shouting: \"See -- they're throwing Jews out!\"\n",

      "\"The protest is not worth any comment,\" he said.\n",
      "\"It was a schoolboy prank, and we are very pleased with the way  it was handled by the security staff.\n",
      "\"The sale itself went very well, the prices exceeded our  expectations.\"\n",

      "The deal, worth 143 million euros (182 million dollars), was  made possible thanks to the French government which stumped up 11.9  million euros to bridge the gap between the selling price and the  EU's offer.\n",
      "While the parliament has owned its main assembly building for  two years, the adjoining buildings have been leased until now.\n",
      "Borrell said the deal would \"safeguard the interests of the town  of Strasbourg and of the parliament,\" which intends to hang on to  its French headquarters despite growing protests over the money  spent to operate it.\n",
      "He added that he did not believe that the 25 European member  states would reach the unanimous agreement required to change the  situation, which sees the parliament alternate between Brussels and  Strasbourg.\n",
      "Campaigners on Wednesday handed the Finnish EU presidency a  one-million-signature petition calling for the European Parliament  to give up its Strasbourg headquarters and move full time to  Brussels to save money.\n",
      "Many EU deputies, particularly those in the eurosceptic ranks,  have also long and loudly complained about the transport  difficulties and the extra costs they face when they travel to  Strasbourg each month.\n",

      "The cost of the \"double seat\" has been put at 200 million euros  (250 million dollars) per year.\n",
      "\"The town has always wanted to be a good host for the European  Parliament, so that it will feel at home,\" said mayor Keller.\n",

      "Embattled Hungarian Prime  Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany was confident of surving local elections  on Sunday, in the face of opposition calls he step down after lying  to the country about the economy.\n",
      "\"I predict good results ... which will not be adequate (for the  opposition) to use as a referendum to say that (people) voted  against the government,\" Gyurcsany said in an interview on ATV  private television late Friday.\n",
      "Riding a wave of far-right anti-government protests,  conservative opposition Fidesz leader Viktor Orban has urged voters  to make the local elections a referendum on the government and its  unpopular austerity package.\n",
      "Orban has said the government had no mandate to pass tax rises  after Gyurcsany admitting in a recording leaked on September 17 that  he concealed the dire state of the economy from voters to win  re-election in April.\n",
      "\"We are living historic times ... and the October 1 elections  will be a watershed,\" Orban said on a taped address aired on  right-wing private television HirTV late Friday.\n",
      "\"On Sunday we will decide if we accept lies and the austerity  package,\" Orban said.\n",
      "The leaked Gyurcsany tape triggered 13 days of anti-government  protests, which erupted into street riots early last week that left  some 250 injured in the worst unrest in Hungary since the end of  communism in 1989.\n",
      "But Gyurcsany has rejected turning Sunday's polls into a  referendum on his leadership, especially after the European  Commission on Tuesday endorsed the austerity programme of tax rises,  mass public sector layoffs and subsidy cuts.\n",
      "Analysts have warned the economy could go into a tailspin  unlesss the public deficit is slashed. Hungary has the highest  public deficit in the European Union at a forecast 10.1 percent of  gross domestic product this year.\n",
      "Gyurcsany appeared buffered from disappointment in Sunday's  ballot, with the most important race for the mayor of Budapest  likely to be won by the Liberal incumbent Gabor Demszky, who is  backed by the prime minister's Socialists.\n",
      "Analysts have said Fidesz needed to win Budapest, where a fifth  of the country's 10 million population live, if it is to have any  chance of unseating Gyurcsany.\n",
      "Gyurcsany said he expected the leftist coalition to win the  mayoral race in Budapest and in most of the the 23 big cities, as  well as most of the capital's 23 districts but to lose its hold in  several county assemblies.\n",
      "Four years ago, the governing parties swept the elections,  winning the mayoral races in 17 of 23 big cities, including  Budapest, and a majority in 15 of 19 county assemblies.\n",
      "\"Now even if Fidesz manages to split these races evenly with the  governing parties, it would be a big defeat for Orban,\" said analyst  Krisztian Szabados, because it would show there is no overwhelming  feeling among voters to oust Gyurcsany.\n",
      "Fidesz has said it will consider itself the winner even if it  loses the capital but wins the majority of the 20 county assemblies,  as polls predict.\n",
      "The main opposition party had a 20 percent lead nationally  against the Socialists, according to a Tarki poll concluded days  before the start of protests.\n",
      "But that lead may have eroded as the left has launched attacks  against Orban, linking him to the far-right demonstrations and the  violence.\n",
      "Orban had urged voters to use the local elections as a  referendum on the government even before the start of far-right  rallies, raising doubts about whether the protests were spontaneous  or politically orchestrated.\n",
      "\"We must admit that there is a clear connection between the  inflammatory rhetoric (of Orban) and the destruction on the  streets,\" Budapest Mayor Demszky told a rally on Thursday.\n",
      "The nightly demonstrations in front of the Hungarian parliament  have faded after reaching a high-point with a turnout of 20,000 last  Saturday evening, with only 2,500 people demonstrating on Friday  night.\n",

      "About 15,000 people demanded the  ouster of Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany during a rally  in front of parliament Saturday, after the country's opposition  leader called for daily protests.\n",
      "The crowd began dispersing less than an hour after the protest  started, which opposition chief Viktor Orban had said he would not  attend.\n",
      "Orban had said Friday demonstrations should continue every day  between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm (1500 and 1600 GMT) until Gyurcsany  quits, during an anti-government protest that drew some 50,000  people, well below the hundreds of thousands expected.\n",

      "LONDON, Oct 9, 2006\n",
      "Indian shipbreaking workers on  Monday called on industry chiefs meeting in London Monday for  tighter regulations to cut the number of serious injuries and deaths  in the sector, particularly in Asia.\n",
      "\"We need the help of the world, we need the help of the people  to help the workers,\" Vidyadhar V. Rane, secretary of the Mumbai  Port Trust Dock and General Employees' Union, told a news conference  here.\n",
      "\"Representation must be there and will help save the lives of  workers from unsafe practices.\"\n",
      "Rane's call came as he and a delegation of Indian workers  arrived to lobby the International Maritime Organisation's Marine  Environment Protection Committee, which began a four-day meeting in  London Monday.\n",
      "Ninety-five percent of old ships are broken up and recycled on  the beaches of India, Bangladesh, China, Pakistan and Turkey but its  poorly-paid employees have to run the gauntlet of life-threatening  hazards on a daily basis.\n",
      "These include fire, explosions, falls from heights and exposure  to asbestos, heavy metals and PVCs.\n",
      "Recycling of ships is on the IMO's agenda but the delegation and  unions want a speedier implementation of internationally-agreed  regulations on breaking up old ships to protect workers and their  livelihoods.\n",
      "No accurate figures exist on how many deaths, injuries and  occupational ill health occur in the global shipbreaking industry  but the International Labour Organisation has classed it as one of  the world's most hazardous jobs.\n",
      "Data from the the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health in  Gujarat, India, showed that two out of every 1,000 workers involved  in shipbreaking in Alang suffered fatal accidents between 1995 and  2005.\n",
      "Deaths in one of the most accident-prone sectors, the mining  industry across the sub-continent, was 0.34 per 1,000 during the  same period.\n",
      "The Indian delegation threw flowers into London's River Thames  Monday in memory of the hundreds of workers who die each year in the  largely unregulated industry.\n",
      "Rob Johnston, director for steel at the International  Metalworkers' Federation which is representing the workers, said:  \"We need to give these workers a voice...\n",
      "\"This is not a backstreet, small industry but a huge industry  which employs tens of thousands of people.\"\n",
      "The need to improve working conditions was particularly acute  because of predictions that the burgeoning Indian steel industry  will source more than a third of its raw materials from ship  breaking in the years to come, he added.\n",
      "\"The IMO is committed to a new international instrument. Our  problem is that it is likely to come into force internationally in  2015. Workers continuing to be killed, injured and exploited until  then is unacceptable,\" he added.\n",
      "According to the IMF, there are about 25 million metalworkers  across the globe.\n",
      "Thousands of workers, many of whom are migrants, die, are  injured or fall ill when recycling ships. They have little or no  legal rights, protective equipment or medical aid and earn only  about one dollar a day.\n",

      "Hungarian police charged a last  group of several hundred protestors early Tuesday in Budapest, after  street riots rocked the capital on the 50th anniversary of the  uprising against Soviet rule.\n",
      "Police, backed by water cannons and firing volleys of tear gas,  used trucks to run over barricades erected by demonstrators on the  Elizabeth bridge over the river Danube.\n",
      "Hundreds of police charged the bridge from both ends as they  squeezed out protestors, who earlier had hurled rocks and Molotov  cocktails and overturned cars in the area.\n",

      "Debate over Islamic veil masks wider issues of integration\n",
      "LONDON, Oct 26, 2006\n",
      "Britain is the latest European  country to become embroiled in a row over the full-face veil, which  reflects wider issues about the extent and nature of Muslim  integration into Western society.\n",
      "With Muslim clothing becoming more visible in recent years, most  \"Old Europe\" countries like Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands  and Belgium, have all had to address the same question to varying  degrees.\n",
      "According to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the niqab --  where a woman's face is entirely covered except for her eyes -- has  often become the most noticeable \"mark of separation\" between  communities.\n",
      "Earlier this month he said that similar discussions to the one  in Britain were happening in most European countries and that  wearing the veil masked a broader debate about integration.\n",
      "In Britain, where the July 7, 2005 suicide bomb attacks held up  the country's much-cherished \"multicultural\" model to new scrutiny,  the debate has centred around the niqab, even though it is worn by  few Muslim women.\n",
      "Last week, a 24-year-old Muslim teaching assistant who was  suspended for refusing to remove the niqab in the classroom, lost  claims of discrimination and harassment against her local education  authority.\n",
      "Aishah Azmi, who is planning to appeal, alleged the veil made no  difference to her competency as a bilingual support worker,  dismissing school claims that it was a bar to face-to-face  communication.\n",
      "As in many European countries, in Britain -- home to 1.6 million  Muslims mainly of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian origin --  decisions on dress codes are mainly taken locally.\n",
      "But France, which has Europe's largest Muslim population at  about five million, is rare in having adopted legislation about the  issue at national level.\n",
      "The wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in state schools,  including the Muslim veil, was outlawed in March 2004 to widespread  controversy.\n",
      "But although few women in France wear the niqab, it still causes  concern to some.\n",
      "One lawmaker in April called for new legislation imposing  two-month jail terms or 3,750-euro (4,700-dollar) fines for  violating the principle that \"any person on French soil must have  their face uncovered for ease of recognition and identification\".\n",
      "Jacques Maynard, from the governing right-of-centre Union for a  Popular Movement, views the niqab as \"a violation of the equality of  the sexes, a very serious threat to the will to live together\".\n",
      "In the Netherlands, where 5.8 percent of the population is  Muslim and female public servants can wear the veil \"unless they  interfere with safety, functionality or impartiality\", the debate is  centred on the little-worn burka.\n",
      "The Dutch parliament last year voted to ban the burka -- which  covers the entire body and head -- in public places but the law has  not yet been applied.\n",
      "The justice ministry has said such a ban would go against other  anti-discrimination legislation.\n",
      "In Germany, home to more than 3.2 million Muslims, mostly of  Turkish origin, some states have changed the law while others are in  the process of legislating on religious symbols in schools.\n",
      "For example, in the conservative-run south-west state of  Baden-Wuerttemberg, teachers were banned from wearing the veil at  school.\n",
      "A new law stated that such clothing could disturb \"the peace of  an establishment and put into doubt the need for state secularity\".\n",
      "But last July, a court in Stuttgart allowed a female primary  school teacher -- herself a Muslim convert -- to wear an Islamic  headscarf in a state school.\n",
      "In mid-October, high-profile Germans of Turkish origin,  including two female lawmakers, launched an appeal to Muslims not to  wear the headscarf to demonstrate their integration.\n",
      "All of which stands at odds with secular Muslim Turkey, which  hopes to join the European Union, where headscarves are banned in  civic spaces, including schools, universities and official  buildings.\n",
      "In Italy, where 1.7 percent of the population is Muslim, Prime  Minister Romano Prodi reignited the issue last week by saying: \"If a  woman wants to wear the veil, all well and good.\"\n",
      "But he added that \"good sense\" demanded that her face should not  be covered.\n",
      "There were clear signs, however, that it is still a sensitive  subject.\n",
      "Last week, Italian lawmaker Daniela Santanche, from the  right-wing National Alliance, was called an infidel by a Muslim  preacher after saying on television that wearing the veil was not  required by the Koran.\n",
      "Santanche was offered police protection while right- and  left-wing politicians rallied in her support, with calls that  Muslims needed to integrate and accept the rules of democracy.\n",
      "Old, and scarcely-enforced, laws banning any appearance in  public while masked have been resurrected although wearing  headscarves in schools is not outlawed.\n",
      "Similar legislation has been enacted in parts of Belgium --  where 4.5 percent of the population is Muslim -- based on those  originally designed to govern the wearing carnival masks.\n",

      "Four thousand extra police were  being drafted into restive French suburbs late Friday, police said,  as a new armed attack on a bus near Paris was reported.\n",
      "The move came on the one-year anniversary of the death of two  teenagers which sent a wave of urban riots surging through France,  sparking the country's most serious social crisis in 30 years.\n",
      "\"Four thousand police have been made available and will  reinforce local personnel in order to ensure the security of  citizens in sensitive districts,\" a national police headquarters  spokesman said.\n",

      "Police said the men were armed but did not specify the weapons  used. They had spread petrol in the vehicle then set it alight.\n",
      "The bus company said the driver and the 15 or so passengers  aboard were not harmed.\n",
      "After starting the fire, the men disengaged the vehicle's brake  and allowed it to roll down a hill where it crashed into a barrier  on a bend in the road, near to homes, according to witnesses.\n",

      "Night after night for three weeks, youth gangs clashed with  police, torching more than 10,000 cars and firebombing 300 buildings  in around 275 towns, until order was officially restored on November  17.\n",
      "With the approach of the anniversary, police and local mayors  have warned that the conditions that led to the riots remain firmly  in place in the poor out-of-town neighbourhoods, plagued by  unemployment of 30 to 40 percent.\n",

      "Scores of private and company vehicles have also been  incinerated, and overnight Sunday, youths threw a stone from a  bridge on a tram in the eastern city of Grenoble, smashing the  window and injuring the driver.\n",
      "Scores of arrests were made in scattered skirmishes with police,  and several officers were slightly hurt.\n",
      "The violence recalled the three weeks of riots that raged in  mostly poor French suburbs a year ago -- the worst civil strife the  country has seen in four decades.\n",
      "Then, gangs of youths, most of them from families of African and  Arab origin living in marginalised neighbourhoods, torched more than  10,000 cars and firebombed 300 buildings in around 275 towns.\n",
      "Although the fresh spate of arson attacks was on a much smaller  scale than the 2005 riots, there were fears that the still-tense  suburbs could explode again.\n",
      "Lingering resentment in high-immigrant areas suffering chronic  youth unemployment four times the national average, coupled with  political sensitivities ahead of presidential and parliamentary  elections due next year have made the situation unpredictable.\n",

      "Chirac on Sunday telephoned the family of the victim -- a  26-year-old Senegalese medical student named as Mama Galledou -- to  express his \"horror at this despicable act\".\n",
      "Marseille bus drivers refused to return to work Sunday following  the attack, and on Monday counterparts in the French Riviera city of  Nice followed suit for several hours out of solidarity.\n",
      "The hospital treating Galledou said she remained between life  and death, with burns to 70 percent of her body. She was on  artificial respiration and in an artificial coma in a burns clinic.  Her parents were due to arrive from Senegal on Monday to be by her  side.\n",
      "The woman was on the bus with some 10 other passengers when it  was forcibly boarded by the two teenagers wearing hoods. They doused  the inside of the vehicle with flammable liquid and set it on fire  before running away.\n",
      "Although the driver and other passengers escaped in time, the  woman was unable to do so.\n",
      "A witness, identified by his first name, Rachid, told Le  Parisien newspaper he saw the woman screaming on the bus.\n",

      "During the 1980s, the group, which demands an independent Scottish republic and Gaelic as its national language, made several hoax bomb and death threats to Britain's royal family. It was linked to an anthrax letter hoax involving letters sent last summer to St. Andrews University in Scotland, where Prince William is studying.\n",

      "``The packages, which arrived by mail, purported to contain eucalyptus oil, but further analysis has revealed they contained a caustic substance,'' a spokesman said.\n",
      "Forensic tests identified the substance as sodium hydroxide, the spokesman said. Sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda, is extremely corrosive and can cause blindness or scarring. It is commonly used in the paper industry and in the manufacture of soaps and detergents.\n",
      "Blair was visiting Australia on Friday to attend a Commonwealth summit. Downing Street refused to comment on what it described as a ``security issue.'' However, a source there said that no one was ever in any danger in the building, as security officials had become suspicious of the package during routine screening.\n",

      "Snoehvit, which is to provide liquefied natural gas for the U.S. and European markets, is the biggest development project ever proposed for Norway's far north and the first in the waters of the Barents Sea.\n",
      "The roughly 40-billion kroner (dlrs 4.5 billion) project would provide badly needed jobs in Finnmark, Norway's northernmost province, thus pitting local business leaders against environmental groups.\n",

      "Elin Lerum Boasson, leader of the Nature and Youth group, had the opposite view and promised to use every legal appeal available to block the project.\n",
      "``This is a horror story,'' she said after a demonstration against the project outside parliament. ``The Snoehvit project is the most controversial in Norwegian oil and gas history. We think it is completely irresponsible to open the Barents Sea, which is so vulnerable and valuable, for oil and gas activity.''\n",
      "The project calls for the development of the Snoehvit natural gas field, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Hammerfest, Norway's northernmost town, by the end of 2006.\n",

      "The Norwegian environmental group Bellona claims the project could endanger the environment of the Barents Seas, a rich fishing and sea bird area.\n",

      "LONDON (AP)\n",
      "Zimbabwean expatriates cast symbolic votes against President Robert Mugabe Saturday as the ballot boxes opened in their homeland.\n",
      "Organizers said they expected several hundred ballots during the 36-hour vigil outside the Zimbabwe High Commission in London, staged in protest against the intense political violence and intimidation of the election campaign.\n",
      "``The Zimbabwean refugees who have fled Mugabe's reign of terror are only a few of the many thousands of voters denied their democratic rights by blatant rigging of the voters' roll,'' said Washington Ali of the Freedom for Zimbabwe Campaign which organized the protest.\n",
      "The presidential elections that began Saturday are the most competitive in the nation's history, pitting Mugabe, the 78-year-old head of the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front party, against opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\n",
      "Ali, a Tsvangirai supporter, said he and other ``exiles'' had been denied postal votes despite a recent Supreme Court ruling to the contrary.\n",
      "Human rights groups and political analysts say the election already is too tainted to be free and fair. Mugabe's government refused to accredit most independent Zimbabwean voting monitors.\n",
      "``People are afraid to go and vote,'' said Tsvangirai supporter Ndabezinhle Sibandu.\n",
      "``They are being told by his notorious youth brigade 'We have cameras and we are watching you.'''\n",
      "Sibandu and fellow protester Patson Muzuwa see violence on the horizon, whatever the outcome of the vote.\n",
      "``If Tsvangirai wins, Mugabe will try to coup with his army,'' said Muzuwa.\n",
      "``And if Mugabe elects himself,'' said Sibandu, ``there will be a bloodbath. The people won't be able to accept him winning.''\n",
      "Menzies Campbell, foreign affairs spokesman for Britain's third largest political party, the Liberal Democrats, said Saturday that ``neither the Commonwealth nor the wider international community can tolerate a fraudulent result in Zimbabwe.''\n",
      "``The Mugabe regime has done everything in its power to intimidate its political opponents and to rig the election,'' he said.\n",
      "``But the courage of the people of Zimbabwe may yet thwart him. The early signs are very encouraging.''\n",
      "The election comes amid the country's worst economic crisis since independence in 1980. Inflation is over 110 percent, unemployment is 60 percent and hundreds of thousands of people are going hungry.\n",

      "Nurses at more than 30 hospitals went on strike for two hours Tuesday in protest chronic overcrowding at many accident and emergency rooms.\n",
      "The government and patients' rights activists warned that the two-hour strike, being followed by an indefinite refusal to do certain jobs such as taking blood samples or answering phones, would endanger lives.\n",
      "``Patients are being used as pawns in a showdown between the government and the nurses,'' said Stephen McMahon, chairman of the Irish Patients Association. ``The justifiable cries of frustration from nurses and health care workers are nothing compared to the frustration of patients with the system.''\n",
      "Union leaders, who agreed not to disrupt emergency services at children's hospitals, insisted they had no choice, and urged the public to go to their doctor instead of a hospital if possible.\n",
      "They emphasized they wanted no extra pay, only better resources, particularly more beds and a greater commitment by doctors to get borderline patients checked out more quickly. Doctors have resisted this course of action, arguing it would lead to more readmissions.\n",

      "Appeals court upholds conviction of Libyan Eds: LEADs with 6 grafs to ADD quote from ruling\n",
      "CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP)\n",
      "A Scottish appeals court Thursday upheld the conviction of a former Libyan intelligence agent for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103, which killed 270 people.\n",
      "The five-judge court ruled unanimously that Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, 49, was responsible for the bomb that brought down the Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n",
      "``We have concluded that none of the grounds of appeal is well founded,'' said the presiding judge, Lord Cullen. ``The appeal will accordingly be refused.''\n",
      "``This brings the procedures to an end,'' he said, closing the book on a a judicial process that took nearly two years and cost dlrs 100 million.\n",
      "In a 200-page judgment, the court said the prosecution had compiled a compelling case of circumstantial evidence that was not shaken by the defense appeal.\n",
      "``In reaching its decision to convict the appellant, the trial court found that the evidence fitted together to form a real and convincing pattern,'' the judges said.\n",
      "Al-Megrahi was found guilty last year of loading an unaccompanied suitcase bomb onto a flight in Malta that was later transferred onto Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded en route from London to New York over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n",
      "His alleged accomplice, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, also a Libyan, was acquitted.\n",
      "Al-Megrahi's wife broke down when the verdict was announced, and was led from the public gallery wailing in grief. The reaction of relatives of the victims, many from the United States and Britain, was muted, mostly a shaking of hands.\n",
      "``Finally there is justice today,'' said Kathleen Flynn, of Montville, N.J., whose 21-year-old son was killed in the plane. Speaking outside the courtroom, she called the ruling a ``milestone against terrorism.''\n",
      "Jim Swire, a spokesman for the British families, said his group would continue to press for an independent inquiry of the ``total failure of security,'' which had become even more relevant after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.\n",
      "Al-Megrahi, who has been held at Camp Zeist since his trial opened in May 2000, was expected to be transferred to a prison in Scotland within hours.\n",
      "The president of the Libyan bar association, Hafid Jhoja, said the court had been swayed by political influence. ``The trial was a political matter, not a legal matter. There was no clear evidence, as the whole world knows,'' he told reporters outside the special courtroom.\n",
      "``All the Libyan people, all the Arab people, are upset by this judgment,'' he said.\n",
      "The verdict will increase pressure on Libya's ruler, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, to pay compensation to the victims to remove sanctions imposed by the United States against the north African country.\n",
      "In London, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he hoped the decision would bring ``solace and comfort'' to the families. ``Libya has shown the desire to turn away from international terrorism,'' he said, but he urged Gadhafi to fulfill his obligations.\n",
      "In the appeal, which opened Jan. 23, al-Megrahi's lawyers argued there had been a miscarriage of justice by the lower court in weighing the evidence. Defense lawyers also presented new evidence they said should cast enough doubt on the prosecution case to overturn the conviction.\n",
      "Two new witnesses told the appeals court they found evidence of a break-in in the baggage area at London's Heathrow Airport hours before the Pan Am flight took off, suggesting that the bomb-laden suitcase could have been loaded in London rather than in Malta, as concluded by the trial court.\n",
      "The original trial, held in the same high-security courtroom on a former U.S. air base in the Netherlands, was presented to a panel of three judges instead of a jury.\n",
      "Prosecutors called 285 witnesses to compile a case of circumstantial evidence that al-Megrahi loaded the unaccompanied suitcase onto the Malta flight.\n",
      "The explosives detonated 38 minutes after takeoff from Heathrow, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground in the village of Lockerbie.\n",
      "During three weeks of appeals hearings, defense lawyers sought to discredit the witnesses who identified al-Megrahi as the man who bought clothing in Malta that investigators said had buffered the bomb inside the suitcase.\n",
      "They also called Heathrow security guard Raymond Manly and his supervisor Philip Radely to testify that they found a broken padlock on a door to a restricted area where luggage was waiting to be loaded onto various Pan Am flights.\n",
      "Although the men told police at the time the break-in looked professional, they were never called to testify to the trial court. Defense lawyers discovered the evidence only after the verdict was delivered Jan. 31, 2001.\n",

      "In new controversy over remembering the victims of the Auschwitz death camp, Polish officials on Monday rejected a Jewish group's protest at plans for a shopping center in a former tannery where some camp inmates worked and died.\n",
      "Commenting on a letter by Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center to Poland's Prime Minister Leszek Miller, officials in Oswiecim, the southern Polish city of 50,000 where the Nazis built the camp, dismissed the accusations as unreasonable.\n",
      "``If we adopted the Rabbi's rationale we would have to close down the whole Oswiecim area, where many prisoners were forced to work, suffered and got killed,'' Jerzy Wroblewski, the head of the Auschwitz State Museum said.\n",
      "``I strongly support commemorating places of mass extermination, but within reasonable limits,'' Wroblewski said. ``The place is a mile away from the proper camp where extermination took place.''\n",
      "The city's mayor, Jozef Krawczyk also said the demands were unacceptable and a spokesman for the Warsaw government, Michal Tober, said the position taken by city and museum authorities was ``rational.''\n",
      "In his letter dated Thursday, Cooper argued that building shops on the premises ``would desecrate the memory of the Holocaust victims.'' He urged Polish leaders to ``stop local authorities and their business allies from turning a quick profit on the ashes of the Holocaust victims.''\n",
      "About 1.5 million people, mostly Jews from around Europe, were killed between 1940 and 1945 in the Auschwitz-Birkenau gas chambers or died from disease, malnutrition and forced labor. Historians say many of about 1,000 prisoners who worked in the tannery died there.\n",
      "Last year, a disco located in the building was closed after months of protests from international Jewish groups, who argued it showed a lack of respect for the victims.\n",
      "The International Auschwitz Council, which supervises the museum and includes representatives of international Jewish communities, will meet in April to discuss the current dispute, Wroblewski said.\n",
      "He said council members didn't object to the planned shopping center when the project was proposed last year. Still, Jewish groups have long opposed allowing businesses to operate on or near Auschwitz-related sites.\n",
      "The site of the camp currently is protected by a 100-meter-wide (100-yard-wide) buffer zone in which commercial activities are prohibited.\n",
      "Over the past few years, Jewish organizations have protested other plans to build a mini-mall across from the Auschwitz museum. The project was later limited to a scaled-down visitors center, part of which opened last year.\n",

      "ROME (AP)\n",
      "An offshoot of the Red Brigades terror group claimed responsibility for the slaying of a government adviser Thursday in a communique posted on the Internet.\n",
      "The claim came a day after Interior Minister Claudio Scajola publicly blamed the group for the murder of economist Marco Biagi, who was working on labor reform _ a bitterly contested issue in Italy.\n",
      "Biagi, a 52-year-old university professor, was the second economist working on labor reform to be gunned down in three years.\n",
      "The claim of responsibility came at the beginning of a 26-page document written in turgid political prose which was e-mailed to an independent regional news agency, Caserta 24 Ore. Caserta 24 Ore posted it on its website Thursday.\n",
      "``An armed nucleus of our organization executed Marco Biagi,'' the document begins, saying Biagi was targeted because his work as a consultant to the labor minister made him part of a government which ``represents the interests of bourgeois imperialism.''\n",
      "The Interior Ministry had no immediate comment on the claim.\n",
      "A day earlier, the interior minister said Biagi was killed with the same 9 mm handgun used in the 1999 slaying of another government economics adviser, Massimo D'Antona.\n",
      "Both men advocated measures to loosen up Italy's labor market, one of the most rigid in Europe, by making it easier to fire workers.\n",
      "The same offshoot of Red Brigades which claimed Biagi's slaying also claimed responsibility for D'Antona's murder, the first claimed by the group in 11 years.\n",
      "The Red Brigades, along with rightist groups, bloodied Italy with terrorist attacks in the 1970s and '80s.\n",
      "Biagi was shot to death Tuesday evening outside his apartment building in Bologna by gunmen on a motorscooter.\n",
      "Shortly afterward, the Red Brigades claimed responsibility in an anonymous phone call to a Bologna newspaper, but investigators were cautious because the terror group's typical claim responsibility is a long communique.\n",
      "The slaying stunned the nation, which has been split over the conservative government's plan to change the labor laws. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets Wednesday in Rome, Bologna and elsewhere to protest political violence.\n",

      "He also mentioned agreement by all the countries, except France, to review agreements to process spent nuclear fuels after current contracts expire.

      "The meeting also was attended by Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, with observers from Russia, Finland, Iceland, Spain and 26 international agencies and non-governmental groups.\n",

      "The two assailants fled in a car driven by a third person who had waited outside the premises.\n",
      "A widower, Priede was father to three children, police said.\n",
      "ETA has killed several councilors as part of its 34-year-old campaign for Basque independence. The group has admitted to killing more than 800 people since it took up arms in 1968. It is blamed for a Mar. 2 explosion which targeted another Socialist party councilor who lost his leg in the blast.\n",
      "``ETA's fanaticism will not beat us,'' said Gemma Zabaleta, a Socialist Basque Parliament member and friend of Priede. ``We have to reach agreement to isolate ETA. This man (Priede) did nothing but work for his people and for this reason they murdered him.''\n",
      "The attack came a day after Priede attended a first anniversary memorial service for fellow Socialist municipal politician Froilan Elespe who was killed by ETA.\n",
      "``Juan fought for freedom and defended life,'' said Basque Socialist deputy Rodolfo Ares. ``In Euskadi (the Basque region), people are killed for their ideas.''\n",

      "ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP)\n",
      "European Union defense ministers opened talks Friday facing calls from NATO to spend more money on modernizing their armed forces or risk Europe's marginalization as a military power.\n",
      "``Unless Europe does more militarily, we will not be able to operate alongside America's rapidly modernizing armed forces,'' NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson warned.\n",
      "``I believe that would be a disaster,'' Robertson told a conference in Prague on Thursday before heading to the EU meeting in Spain.\n",
      "As well as discussing Europe's military capability, the two-day talks are scheduled to address closer EU cooperation in fighting terrorism, plans for an EU force to take over NATO's peacekeeping task in Macedonia and efforts to consolidate Europe's fractured armaments market.\n",
      "The EU's own foreign and security chief Javier Solana, also chided the 15 ministers. ``European defense spending has steadily declined throughout the 1990s,'' he told the meeting. ``Our ambitions ... must be matched by adequate efforts in the area of defense spending.''\n",
      "The meeting was being held amid tight security in Spain's military academy on the outskirts of Zaragoza in the north. Over 1,000 police and civil guard officers were deployed to head off the risk of terrorist attack or a repeat of the rioting outside last weekend's EU summit in Barcelona.\n",
      "Antimilitary groups planned demonstrations Friday and Saturday.\n",
      "NATO commanders complain that European forces lack the heavy transport planes needed to get troops to crisis spots quickly, precision attack weapons, electronic warfare equipment, up-to-date intelligence gear, missile defense and special forces.\n",
      "Figures released by the alliance show U.S. military spending scheduled at dlrs 305.9 billion last year was almost double that spent by all the European NATO members _ even before U.S. President George W. Bush announced a dlrs 40 billion anti-terrorist package after Sept. 11.\n",
      "The dlrs 159 billion NATO's European nations do spend on defense is often misdirected, or wasted through duplication because of poor coordination among the 15 EU states, Solana said.\n",
      "``For an aggregate that represents roughly half the U.S. budget, the Europeans are far from producing half of the capability,'' Solana said.\n",
      "With economies slowing and budgets tight, European nations are reluctant to increase defense spending.\n",

      "Union rally draws hundreds of thousands to Rome to protest labor reform and terrorist slaying, organizers predict 2 million participants\n",
      "ROME (AP)\n",
      "With many waving Communist flags, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators streamed into Rome Saturday, answering union leaders' calls to protest Premier Silvio Berlusconi's efforts to make it to easier to fire workers, as well as to denounce the terrorist slaying of a government adviser on labor reform.\n",
      "Union leaders said it appeared that at least 2 million people were pouring into the Italian capital for the rally, but police cautioned that it was too soon to give a crowd count.\n",
      "However, with many last-minute participants still swelling the crowd, aerial camera views indicated that several hundreds of thousands had arrived by early afternoon.\n",
      "The boulevard lining the Tiber was a sea of red caps and swirling red Communist flags and crimson union banners as participants marched toward the rallying point in Circus Maximus, the ancient Roman open space for entertainment. The boulevard leading from the Colosseum to Circus Maximus was also jammed by protesters.\n",
      "Organizers charted scores of buses, trains, two ships and three planes to bring supporters to Rome.\n",
      "The Communist-backed CGIL labor confederation had originally planned concerts after a day of pep talks by union leaders, but the entertainment was canceled in a sign of respect for Marco Biagi, the economist and government consultant who was gunned down Tuesday night in Bologna in an attack claimed by the Red Brigades, a leftist group which had terrorized the country with assassinations and kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.\n",
      "Biagi, through his role as a chief drafter of the legislation aimed at ending Italy's system of virtual lifetime employment, was the union's opponent. But organizers declared that the rally would also denounce the terrorist attack as an attack on democracy.\n",
      "Participants bowed their heads when the rally began with a minute of silence in respect for Biagi.\n",
      "CGIL leader Sergio Cofferati told the crowd that the killing was carried out just when ``workers and citizens were mobilizing to claim their legitimate rights.''\n",
      "Many politicians from the center and left joined the rally.\n",
      "Said former Premier Massimo D'Alema, a leader of the Democratic Left, a former Communist party: ``We're here to say no to terrorism.''\n",
      "On Friday night, Berlusconi, in a recorded messaged broadcast on state TV and the media magnate's private TV networks, reiterated his government's resolve to push the reform through Parliament. Opposition politicians immediately accused Berlusconi of taking advantage of Biagi's slaying to push his agenda, and noted the televised appeal came on the eve of the protest.\n",
      "Security Saturday was heavy, and the rally began peacefully.\n",
      "About a dozen extra police were posted outside Berlusconi's residence about a kilometer (half-mile) from the rallying point. A police helicopter circled over Circus Maximus, and scores of police lined an ancient Roman bridge spanning the Tiber near the crowd.\n",
      "Romans and tourists were forced to walk for kilometers (miles) as most bus runs through the center were scrapped or shortened.\n",
      "The drive to liberalize labor laws had split the country, and days before the attack, Italy's largest, leftist union confederation had invited citizens to rally in Rome against the change.\n",
      "When Berlusconi first was premier in 1994, he backed off on pension reform after mass protests by workers in the streets.\n",
      "This time, Italy's main labor confederations have called for a general strike in April to protest the labor reform.\n",
      "The conservative premier has insisted that Italy's rigid employment system must be loosened in order to create more jobs so businesses can stay competitive. Many employers have long complained that it is so hard to fire workers in Italy that they are discouraged from taking on new employees when demand increases for their products or services because it will almost be impossible to let them go later.\n",

      "Many Basques and Spaniards want the group to declare a cease-fire, as it did in 1998, though it lasted only 14 months.\n",
      "Since then, ETA has claimed or been blamed for another 39 killings, including the March 21 shooting of Socialist councilor Juan Priede Perez in a suburb of San Sebastian.\n",

      "Carmelo Barrio, a regional official in Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party, said the statement amounted to ``a new blackmail and death threat.''\n",
      "However, Xabier Arzalluz, president of the Basque Nationalist Party which heads the region's autonomous government, told reporters that ``there are radicals on both sides,'' and accused Aznar's government of lacking a peace strategy for the region.\n",

      "Protesters have also set up road blocks along other roads in northern Greece, and have intermittently shut down a border crossing with Bulgaria.\n",

      "The government has insisted it is unable to increase cotton subsidies due to EU regulations, and has repeatedly called on the farmers to lift their blockades.

      "A short anonymous letter received late Monday warned that ``a huge explosion'' would take place at the stadium if the Denmark-Israel match is played, federation spokesman Lars Berendt said.\n",
      "The letter, written in Danish, also stated that ``both spectators and the Danish World Cup players will be in danger'' and ended with the words ``Free Palestine.''\n",
      "Police and soccer officials said they were taking the threat seriously but pointed out that extra security measures already were in place with at least two major anti-Israel demonstrations scheduled in Copenhagen ahead of the game on Wednesday.\n",
      "``We see this as a threat and all bomb threats are always taken very seriously,'' police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said Tuesday. ``But it won't make us take any further security measures; we're already at the level needed.''\n",
      "Police announced earlier this month that they were stepping up security at the game due to Israel's offensive against Palestinian militias, which has drawn international criticism.\n",
      "Bomb sniffing dogs have been making regular sweeps of the Danish and Israeli training grounds and a fence was erected around the downtown, 40,000-seat Parken stadium to separate demonstrators from people with tickets.\n",
      "Police and stadium officials also planned two checkpoints to search people as they go through the perimeter fence and when they enter the stadium.\n",
      "In line with normal practice, police declined to say how many officers would be involved in the operation, but local media speculated it could be up to 2,000, or 20 percent of Denmark's police force.\n",
      "The soccer federation gave players the option of withdrawing, but nobody was expected to do so, despite the security situation and calls from Palestinian groups and left-wing lawmakers that the game be canceled or boycotted.\n",
      "``Our opinion on the general question of mixing or separating sports and politics is ... that it's our job to keep the two things apart to the extent that it's possible,'' team captain Jan Heintze said on behalf of the Danish players.\n",
      "``We believe the Danish government, the European Union and United Nations are better than us at evaluating the current situation (in the Middle East),'' Heintze said.\n",
      "About 17,600 tickets have been sold, but local media reported that hundreds of supporters have asked for their money back citing the security hazard or for political reasons. The soccer federation would not comment on those reports.\n",
      "Denmark, a Scandinavian country of 5.3 million people, has about 15,000 residents with Palestinian roots.\n",
      "The Danes will face defending champion France, Senegal and Uruguay in Group A in their third World Cup appearance.\n",

      "Government condemns vandalism at Holocaust memorial, Jewish\n",
      "ATHENS, Greece (AP)\n",
      "The government on Wednesday condemned acts of vandalism at a Holocaust memorial and a Jewish cemetery.\n",
      "Government spokesman Christos Protopappas described both incidents as ``barbaric'' and said he had not thought it possible for such acts to take place in Greece.\n",
      "Red paint was splashed Tuesday over the Holocaust memorial in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, and the word ``Palestinians'' was written in paint nearby. In the northwestern city of Ioannina, three gravestones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery.\n",
      "``We consider it unacceptable and condemn in the most categorical way this barbaric act. We condemn it unanimously and wholeheartedly,'' Protopappas said.\n",
      "The incidents occurred a day after a large pro-Palestinian demonstration was held in Thessaloniki. Similar protests also have been held in Athens.\n",
      "Greece's Holocaust monument was unveiled in 1997 to honor Jews killed in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, reducing a community of 80,000 people to 5,000. The memorial had been vandalized two years ago.\n",
      "A memorial service was held at the monument Sunday and attended by senior government officials.\n",
      "``This monument is dedicated to Greeks ... and I truly feel that I have to express the total aversion of the government toward this action,'' Protopappas said.\n",
      "In an announcement issued after the vandalism, the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, representing Jews nationwide, warned of the ``rekindling racist hatred'' and called for greater government protection of Jewish sites.\n",
      "Attacks against Jewish targets have occurred in several European countries over the past two weeks.\n",

      "Vandals destroyed 135 tombstones at a Jewish cemetery in Slovakia's second-largest city over the weekend, a rabbi said Monday.\n",
      "Rabbi Jossi Steiner said the desecrations were discovered Sunday by a visitor to the cemetery in Kosice in eastern Slovakia. Dozens of grave markers were torn down, and some were broken into several pieces, he said.\n",
      "``Those mute stones couldn't cry out, so they knocked them down,'' an angry Steiner told The Associated Press by telephone from Kosice, 420 kilometers (260 miles) east of the capital, Bratislava, and home to the country's second-largest Jewish community.\n",
      "Steiner said the same cemetery was attacked by vandals several years ago, though not to this extent. He did not elaborate on the earlier attack.\n",
      "During World War II, when the formerly communist country served as a puppet state to Nazi Germany, about 70,000 Jews were sent to concentration camps, where most perished; today, only about 3,000 Jews remain in Slovakia.\n",
      "As police searched for the vandals, Kosice's city hall issued a statement strongly protesting ``the largest attack on the Jewish community in our city since the Holocaust.''\n",
      "City hall spokeswoman Zuzana Bobrikova said Kosice's reputation as a peaceful and tolerant city was damaged by the act, which she said ``casts a shadow on these attributes.''\n",
      "``At a time when tensions are growing in the Middle East, we consider such act to be ill-considered and condemnable,'' she said in a statement.\n",

      "Vivendi faces some dissatisfied shareholders at annual meeting in Paris\n",
      "PARIS (AP)\n",
      "Media giant Vivendi Universal reported improved first-quarter results, but the good news wasn't likely to help chief Jean-Marie Messier at the company's annual meeting Wednesday, where protesters and shareholders alike demanded his resignation.\n",
      "Riot police stood guard as shareholders walked through a crowd of angry demonstrators from Canal Plus, Vivendi's pay television unit, furious at Messier's sacking of their former top executive.\n",
      "Protesters wore T-shirts that said ``Messier mega liar,'' and many shareholders joined in chants of, ``Messier resign,'' frustrated at the company's falling share price, huge 2001 net loss, and unclear strategy.\n",
      "``Messier has to go. That's why we're here,'' said shareholder Yves Viet, a businessman, as he walked into the meeting at Paris' Zenith theater.\n",
      "On April 16, Messier fired Canal Plus chairman Pierre Lescure, saying the loss-making company needed new management to lift it from a debt of dlrs 4.45 billion.\n",
      "The dismissal drew rowdy protests from Canal Plus employees and questions from French politicians about how Lescure, a stalwart against Hollywood domination of the film industry, had been brusquely pushed aside.\n",
      "Announcing first-quarter results Wednesday, Vivendi said that operating profit at its media and telecommunications business grew 27 percent on a pro-forma basis to 436 million euros in the first quarter of the year from 343 million euros (about dlrs 305 million).\n",
      "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to 1.17 billion euros (dlrs 1.04 billion) from 1.01 billion euros (dlrs 898 million) on a pro-forma basis, slightly ahead of expectations.\n",
      "Revenue grew 12 percent pro-forma to 7.11 billion euros (dlrs 6.32 billion). Excluding revenue from the trade-and-health publishing activities sold last week, the figure was 6.8 billion euros (dlrs 6.05 billion), Vivendi said.\n",
      "Revenue growth was driven by the U.S. movie business, with Universal Studios revenue up 24 percent, and by telecom operations. The expected decrease in music was kept in check. Music revenue was down 6 percent, while some observers had predicted a decline of up to 15 percent.\n",
      "In a statement, Messier said that gains will be driven in the future by those units which currently contribute negatively to Vivendi's cash-flow, namely pay-TV group Canal Plus and Internet operations.\n",
      "``We have recently changed Canal Plus' management,'' Messier said. ``We fully understood that this would cause a period of disruption, but are confident that all of our constituencies will soon recognize that this vital step will help create benefits for all''.\n",
      "Messier is likely to face tough questions on Vivendi's strategy at Wednesday evening's meeting.\n",
      "Vivendi's share price has fallen around 70 percent in the past two years as investors _ once impressed with Messier's capacity to pull off acquisitions such as Seagram and educational publisher Houghton Mifflin _ have grown nervous about his ability to meld together the company's diverse businesses and reduce its borrowings.\n",
      "Le Monde newspaper reported in its Wednesday edition that a French minority shareholders body will ask a French court to appoint an expert to look into the way communications giant Vivendi Universal's board of directors operates.\n",
      "The newspaper said that Colette Neuville, president of the shareholders' group ADAM, said the complaint would be filed with a French court next month.\n",
      "``This company has posted huge losses. But we don't know how we got there,'' Le Monde quoted Neuville as saying.\n",

      "WARSAW, Poland (AP)\n",
      "Polish farmers staged a noisy protest against the European Union in the capital Monday, ignoring a government appeal to tone down their opposition ahead of June referendum on joining the EU.\n",
      "About 2,500 farmers marched through Warsaw behind a truck carrying an effigy of Prime Minister Leszek Miller and two gallows with the inscription ``Today the Farmers, Tomorrow the Government''  _  a sign of their anger at Polish officials and fears that EU competitors will put them out of business.\n",
      "Miller pledged Monday to struggle on with a minority government after ejecting the Peasants Party from his left-wing coalition, raising concern the pro-farm party could join other opposition groups campaigning against EU membership.\n",
      "The newly appointed agriculture minister, Adam Tanski, said he wanted the demonstrations to stop to make way for a ``dialogue in peace and mutual trust.''\n",
      "But the protesters were unmoved, stopping before the presidential palace and Miller's offices in Warsaw to hear radical farmers' leader Andrzej Lepper lambast the government for Poland's lame economy and high unemployment.\n",
      "``It's a shame the Peasants Party has left the government because now there is no one to push our interests,'' said Sabina Pietrzyk, a 43-year-old milk and beef producer from Adamow, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Warsaw.\n",
      "``It will be much harder now'' to persuade farmers to back EU membership in the referendum, she said.\n",
      "``The EU means the destruction of Polish farming,'' said Jan Tyczynski, a 31-year-old poultry farmer.\n",
      "The farmers, who have staged regular protests against the government and the terms for Poland's expected EU membership next year, also demanded higher prices for livestock and more farm subsidies.   (ms-swg-tc)\n",

      "Small German firm becomes the first to lose U.S. business over Germany's anti-war stand\n",
      "BERLIN (AP)\n",
      "A small eastern German company on Wednesday became the first to announce a boycott by an American company over Berlin's refusal to back the U.S. administration's moves to disarm Iraq militarily.\n",
      "Lederett CEO Grit Kuhn notified Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in a letter last Friday that the U.S. firm Eneco International Ltd., based in Auburn, Maine would no longer buy leatherboard from the firm because of Germany's anti-war policies. She said the deal was worth 46,000 euros (US$50,000) annually to the firm, employing 46 people in the Saxony town of Siebenlehn.\n",
      "Eneco owner Norman Farrar said in a letter dated Feb. 18 he was calling off future purchases despite being pleased with the quality, service and price.\n",
      "``The prime reason for this decision is due to the lack of support for the U.S. by the Federal Republic of Germany,'' Farrar wrote.\n",
      "Kuhn appealed to the chancellor to change his position, accusing him of sacrificing the German-American friendship ``on the altar of short-term political success.''\n",
      "``We ask the German government to modify its anti-war stance in the case of Iraq for the protection of German industry,'' Kuhn said in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n",
      "Germany's opposition to war  _\twhich started during Schroeder's campaign for re-election last summer  _  has prompted scattered calls in the United States for boycotts of French and German products. But Lederett is the only known victim to date, according to the German government and the German-American Chamber of Commerce.\n",
      "A government spokesman in Berlin refused to comment on the case. However, concerns that the rift over Iraq could hamper commerce  _ worth 113 billion euros (US $122 billion) a year  _  prompted a two-day meeting last month in Bonn of German and U.S. business and political leaders. They expressed confidence that any fallout would be limited.\n",
      "But Lederett has already lost its largest American customer, which Kuhn said the company fought two years to secure, and has been supplying for two years.\n",
      "She indicated broader concerns for the well-being of the 60-year-old firm, noting that 90 percent of its production is for export.\n",
      "``We don't know how many similar reactions German industry must experience,'' she said. ``However, we are sure that the German government would react if, for example, the automotive industry was similarly affected.''\n",
      "Rather than showing any signs of softening its anti-war stance, Germany  _  along with France and Russia  _  on Wednesday said they will ``not allow'' passage of a U.N. resolution to authorize war against Iraq.\n",

      "LONDON (AP)\n",
      "Construction of a rowing center for the 2004 Athens Olympics threatens an ancient Greek site and should be stopped, a group of intellectuals wrote in a British newspaper Thursday.\n",
      "The rowing venue at Schinias would ``irrevocably destroy'' the site of the 490 B.C. Battle of Marathon, which lent its name to the modern race, composer Michael Nyman and 22 others wrote in a letter to The Daily Telegraph.\n",
      "The signers included residents of Britain, the United States and France.\n",
      "``In years to come, when the games are long forgotten, future generations will not forgive this vandalism,'' the letter read. ``The current situation is a modern Greek tragedy.''\n",
      "Archaeologists in Greece have also raised concern about building the rowing venue at Schinias, 28 kilometers (18 miles) northeast of Athens, while environmental groups say the project endangers birds, fish, and a rare species of pine.\n",
      "Nyman, along with experts in archaeology and ancient history and others, urged the Greek authorities to choose a different location for the rowing center. They dismissed government claims that the Schinias site was under water at the time of the Athenians' famed victory over the Persians.\n",
      "``In autumn 2002, a Bronze Age village was found in the middle of the construction area, clearly demonstrating that the site was not under water at that date.''\n",

      "Spokeswoman Eva Brozova said the 19-year-old set himself ablaze in Prague's central Wenceslas Square shortly before 7:30 a.m. (0630 GMT) and died in an ambulance 40 minutes later.\n",
      "Interior Minister Stanislav Gross told Czech radio the young man had left a letter in which he complained about the political situation in the Czech Republic. Police refused to reveal any further details.\n",
      "The news agency CTK identified the young man as Zdenek Adamec, a high-school student from Humpolec, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of Prague.\n",
      "``The action called Torch 2003 is the continuation of protests against the evil which is tolerated throughout the world,'' the man said in what an Internet page of the daily Pravo published as his good-bye letter, referring to his planned self-immolation. ``Drugs, violence, money and power.

      "BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)\n",
      "About 3,000 protesters called on lawmakers Tuesday to open the files of the former communist regime's secret police, forming a human chain around the symbolically charged palace of the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.\n",
      "The protesters\t_  whose numbers included workers, nuns, students and self-described victims of the intelligence agency known as the Securitate  _  joined hands around the 3-kilometer (2-mile) perimeter of the vast palace, which houses parliament. They chanted: ``You have the power, you hold the (Securitate) files, but you don't have a drop of honor.''\n",
      "They said Romanians have the right to know who had once spied on ordinary citizens for the feared agency, which had an estimated 700,000 informers and nearly 40,000 officers when communism ended in 1989.\n",
      "The demonstrators also voiced anger that many former Securitate agents, who held privileged positions under Ceausescu, hold high positions today in business, politics and the media.\n",
      "``The political stage is full of former Securitate officers,'' said Bogdan Alexandru, a 22-year-old economics student. ``They cast a long shadow over our society and Parliament.''\n",
      "Legislation was passed in 1999 allowing for the opening of the communist-era files, but it hasn't yet been fully implemented due to resistance by the current intelligence service, the custodian of the files, some members of the ruling leftist Party of Social Democracy and the nationalist Greater Romania Party.\n",
      "``It is the first time that workers, intellectuals and young people have joined hands and called for the past to be clarified,'' said Mircea Dinescu, a poet and former anti-communist dissident, who is on the council responsible for opening the files. ``This must worry the ruling party.''\n",
      "The council does not have access to the files and some of its members regularly accuse the intelligence service and lawmakers of working to block the publication of the files.\n",
      "Another protester, 63-year-old Nicolae Vasilescu, a retired architect, wore a poster naming 15 officers and a dozen informers who he said had spied on him. He said it would be ``morally beneficial'' for the country to open the files.\n",
      "``I found out that neighbors and friends and colleagues spied on me,'' said Vasilescu, who said he was first arrested when he was 16 for organizing protests against the Soviet Union. ``They even had a file on my son when he was 11.''\n",
      "The leader of the Greater Romania Party, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, on Monday called Dinescu and others who want the files opened ``irresponsible.'' He has long argued that opening the files would open old wounds and cause bitter divisions among Romanians.\n",
      "At the rally were a group of nuns who had traveled 250 kilometers (155 miles) from their convent in the Danube port of Galati, demanding that the Orthodox Church publish the names of priests who collaborated with the Securitate.\n",
      "``We don't want punishment for former Securitate officers, but we don't want to continue this cover-up, which is a lie,'' said Sister Liliana, who said she had been questioned by the Securitate.\n",

      "A radical change of policy is underway in the home of smoke-filled cafes and pungent Gauloises cigarettes: The French government has launched the most aggressive anti-smoking campaign since tobacco was introduced here centuries ago.\n",
      "Officials are pressuring the movie industry to stop glorifying smokers and are cracking down on cigarette sales to minors and smoking in public places. The government is also steeply raising cigarette taxes  _  one hike came at the start of the year, while another is planned Monday and a third in January.\n",
      "``This is a war against smoking, and we're attacking from all angles,'' said Helene Monard, a spokeswoman for the Health Ministry's anti-smoking division. ``We've never had a campaign this strong. Never.''\n",
      "France has long been a smoker's paradise, where lighting up is considered sophisticated and chic. Some 20 million French smoke  _ over a third of the population\t_  as do 50 percent of youths aged 15-24, the highest rate in the European Union.\n",
      "The country, however, is slowly waking up to the ugly side of its tobacco habit: Lung cancer was the leading cause of death in people under 65 last year, and smoking-related illnesses claimed 66,000 lives.\n",
      "If not for health reasons, many smokers are increasingly weighing the cost to their wallets.\n",
      "The three tax hikes in 12 months will make France one of the most expensive places on the continent to smoke.\n",
      "The average price per pack of cigarettes, currently at EUR 3.90 euros (US$4.60), will rise to EUR 4.60 (US$5.40) Monday and then to about EUR 5.40 (US$6.30) next year  _  roughly a 50 percent increase in the span of a year.\n",

      "While it's too early to predict if France's passion for smoking will fade, the government has made a clear turnaround in policy.\n",
      "For years, the country's lucrative tobacco industry was state-owned, and cracking down on smoking meant cutting into government revenue. But Seita  _  the maker of Gauloises  _  was privatized in 1995 before forming the Franco-Spanish group, Altadis.\n",
      "Health costs associated with smoking have become a growing burden. The state health care system has a record deficit of EUR 10.9 billion (US$12.8 billion) this year, partly from the costs of cancer treatment.\n",

      "Training for a nightmare officials hope will never come, but fear nonetheless, Paris police and rescue services carried out their first full-scale exercise Thursday to test their response to a chemical attack.\n",
      "The simulation started bang on time, just before midnight (2200 GMT), with suspected terrorists spilling a liquid that released ``toxic'' gas in the Invalides Metro and suburban train station on Paris' Left Bank.\n",
      "Pretend victims, wearing signs around their necks which listed their symptoms, littered the platform and a train that had pulled in. The station is close to Les Invalides, a gold-domed former hospital that houses Napoleon Bonaparte's tomb.\n",
      "The imaginary attack, which was to involve 500 police and rescue service officers, illustrated the extent to which the French consider themselves a potential terrorist target. Over the past two years, police have dismantled alleged terror cells and uncovered potential attack plots.\n",
      "Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who was to attend the exercise, said the simulation came out of a request law enforcement had made to President Jacques Chirac.\n",
      "``This exercise is a way of being ready, even if there is no specific threat,'' he told the National Assembly on Wednesday. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin was also scheduled to attend.\n",
      "The simulation will be followed by some 50 similar exercises around France next year, Sarkozy said.\n",
      "Trying to make the exercise as real as possible, police officials updated reporters on their progress as the simulation unfurled. After about an hour, police announced that tests had determined that the toxic gas had been identified as sarin. That was, of course, make-believe but sarin has already been proven to be a deadly threat.\n",
      "The nerve agent, developed by the Nazis, was used in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway by doomsday cult Aum Shinri Kyo that killed 12 people and sickened thousands. The assault was one of the worst acts of urban terrorism until the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.\n",

      "The exercise, the first of its kind in the French capital, comes less than a week after France reduced its terror alert status to the lowest level, signaling that the risk of attacks has receded. But officials and experts say France needs to remain on guard.\n",
      "Last December, French authorities dismantled what they said was a terror cell with ties to Chechen rebels and al-Qaida that planned bomb or toxic gas attacks in France and Russia.\n",
      "``It's about time we had one of these exercises,'' said Francois Heisbourg, director of the Foundation for Strategic Research think-tank. While France has proved itself capable of coping with natural disasters, it has not had to deal with terror attacks with mass destruction weapons.\n",

      "\"It's not that we would turn somebody in to the police if he says something crazy in a moment of anger,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"It's about repeated examples of sowing hate or encouraging violence.\"\n",
      "An outsider to a mosque who made such remarks would attract immediate attention, Dag said. At least two other Amsterdam mosques have signed on for the plan, developed in collaboration with the city government, and others are considering it.\n",
      "\"I'm pleased and proud,\" said Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende after the outline of the plan was presented to him in the Hague.\n",
      "Van Gogh was a prominent critic of the treatment of women under fundamentalist Islam, and his murder on Nov. 2 set off a month of retaliatory attacks on Muslim targets in a country once renowned for its peace and tolerance.\n",

      "On that day, tens of thousands of mourners lined the river to pay their last respects.\n",

His state funeral was the largest ever in Britain, with a mile-and-a-half-long (two-and-a-half-kilometer-long) procession following his coffin in London.

      "Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen met Tuesday with prominent Danish Muslims to discuss terrorism, three Muslim lawmakers who boycotted the meeting accused the government of demonizing Islam by not inviting followers of other religions.\n",
      "After the nearly three-hour discussion at the prime minister's official residence north of Copenhagen, Fogh Rasmussen said it had been \"a good and positive meeting.\"\n",
      "\"Everyone around the table took a clear and straightforward distance from any kind of terrorism,\" he said after meeting with the 19 Muslim representatives, including imams and leading activists.\n",
      "He said one of the main topics discussed was how to avoid the spread of Islamic extremism among immigrant youths in Denmark after the London bombings.\n",
      "\"The imams who took part said they felt co-responsible for making sure that young people with a Muslim background are not drawn by fanatic and extremist groups,\" Fogh Rasmussen said.\n",
      "All three Muslim parliamentarians invited to the meeting declined to attend. Kamal Qureshi, a Muslim lawmaker from the opposition Socialist People's Party, said \"Fogh Rasmussen is making a direct connection between terrorism and Muslims.\"\n",
      "The invitation informed participants that the government would provide translators if needed, which also angered some of the invitees.\n",
      "\"I just wonder what language Fogh Rasmussen would speak since he has offered interpreters,\" Qureshi said.\n",
      "Lawmakers Huseyin Arac and Naser Khadar also declined the invitation.\n",
      "Arac said the invitations should have been based on political, rather than religious affiliation.\n",
      "\"I am more than willing to meet with the prime minister if he wants to hear some good advice from the Social Democrats,\" he said.\n",
      "There was criticism even among those who decided to participate in the meeting. Five of them issued a statement Tuesday urging the government to \"clarify that they were not invited because they are Muslims but as representatives of (our different) organizations.\"\n",
      "There was no immediate reaction from the government.\n",
      "Nearly 150,000 Muslims live in Denmark, representing 2.8 percent of the country's 5.4 million residents.\n",

      "Blair surprised by scale of insurgency in Iraq, vows British troops will stay the course\n",
      "BRIGHTON, England\n",
      "Prime Minister Tony Blair on Sunday acknowledged he was surprised by the ferocity of the insurgency in Iraq, but defended Britain's commitment to remain in the country.\n",
      "The issue is sure to cloud his governing Labour Party's annual conference, as recent violence thrusts Iraq back into the media spotlight and intensifies questions about when British troops will pull out.\n",
      "\"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that what is happening in Iraq now is crucial for our own security,\" Blair told the British Broadcasting Corp. as the weeklong conference opened in the southern coastal town of Brighton. \"Never mind the security of Iraq or the greater Middle East. It is crucial for the security of the world.\"\n",
      "Blair was asked whether he had expected it to be so difficult to restore order in Iraq following the U.S.-led invasion.\n",
      "\"No, I didn't expect quite the same sort of ferocity from every single element in the Middle East that came in and is doing their best to disrupt the political process,\" he said, referring to insurgents who have flooded into Iraq from neighboring countries such as Syria and Iran. \"But I have absolutely no doubt as to what we should do. We should stick with it.\"\n",
      "Britain has some 8,500 troops in Iraq, headquartered in the southern city of Basra. Blair's decision to back the U.S.-led invasion caused his popularity to plummet and cost Labour dearly in national elections earlier this year. Although the party won a historic third term in office, its huge parliamentary lead was slashed, raising questions about Blair's leadership and undermining his authority.\n",
      "Blair hopes to concentrate on domestic issues during the conference and to rally the party behind his program for reforming public services.\n",
      "But images of angry Iraqis pelting British soldiers with Molotov cocktails and a diplomatic rift over the arrest and subsequent jail break of two British soldiers in Basra have reignited criticism of the way Blair has handled the conflict.\n",
      "Blair insisted that the two soldiers who were arrested last week after allegedly shooting two Iraqi policemen would not be handed over to Iraqi authorities. The men, who were operating undercover, were rescued from prison by a British armored patrol which crashed through the jail walls. The situation prompted a riot in Basra during which a British patrol came under attack by local residents.\n",
      "\"We will do whatever is necessary to protect our troops in any situation,\" Blair told the BBC. Asked if Britain would accept arrest warrants for the soldiers, Blair responded: \"No, absolutely not.\"\n",
      "Blair has faced repeated calls from political opponents to set out a timetable for withdrawing British troops from Iraq. A government memorandum leaked earlier this year shows Britain is considering scaling back its troop presence to 3,000 by the middle of next year.\n",
      "London is reluctant, however, to publicly set a timetable, fearing it could encourage militants. On Sunday, Defense Secretary John Reid insisted that no date has been set.\n",
      "He dismissed a report in The Observer newspaper Sunday that Britain was drawing up detailed plans to begin leaving Iraq in May, and reiterated Britain's long-held position that troop withdrawals depended on the ability of Iraqi forces to secure the country.\n",
      "\"When that condition has been met, we will hand over the lead in counter-terrorism to the Iraqis,\" Reid told Sky News. \"There will then be a process _ it won't happen overnight _ where they gradually take the lead, we gradually withdraw to barracks and we gradually withdraw from Iraq itself ... that is possible to start in some parts of the country, that handover, in the course of next year.\"\n",
      "Blair helped catapult Labour to power, after 18 years in opposition, by shifting the traditionally left-wing party toward the center. But his ongoing plans to encourage greater private sector involvement in state-run public services, such as education and health care, have angered many Labour members.\n",
      "Trade unionists, still a potent force in the party, have tabled several motions calling on the government to strengthen the rights of workers to strike, to halt market reforms of the health service and protect state pensions, which are in crisis due to an aging population.\n",
      "The motions, to be debated and voted on by delegates, cannot force the government to alter policy, but defeats would prove embarrassing for Blair.\n",
      "Security is tight in Brighton, with some 1,300 police officers on duty. Some 300 protesters, many wearing black hoods and orange boiler suits, gathered outside the conference center Sunday calling for the release of a British resident being held at Guantanamo Bay.\n",
      "Activists say Omar Deghayes, a 35-year-old Libyan, has been held for three years at the U.S. camp for three years after being seized in Pakistan.\n",

      "Italian Catholic Church lays out political agenda, sparking protests of interference\n",
      "ROME\n",
      "When Italy's most influential cardinal received an award recently, he was heckled by a group of students opposed to his stand against full legal rights for unmarried couples.\n",
      "\"Shame! Shame!\" the students shouted at Cardinal Camillo Ruini, holding up posters saying \"Free love in a free state\" and \"We're all homosexuals.\"\n",
      "It was a remarkable display _ not just because cardinals are rarely booed in Italy.\n",
      "The students' anger was a measure of how the Roman Catholic Church has regained its role as a powerful force in Italy's political debate, weighing in on hot campaign issues and forcing politicians to take a stand ahead of general elections next year.\n",
      "\"Certainly it is one of the periods of maximum mobilization of the Church,\" Vatican expert Andrea Tornielli said Monday. \"I believe the Church is worried that the traditional family based on marriage is attacked and weakened through legislation.\"\n",
      "The Church in Italy kept a lower profile after the Christian Democrats, with whom the Vatican had close ties, collapsed under the corruption scandals of the early 1990s. But a successful campaign asking Italians to boycott a referendum on easing assisted fertility restrictions in April appears to have emboldened the bishops, analysts say.\n",
      "\"The referendum gave Ruini the belief that he had more sway over public opinion than even he imagined,\" said Giuseppe Alberigo, a Church historian.\n",
      "In one of his first acts in office, Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged the secular nature of the Italian state during a visit with the Italian president. But he also made it clear during the June 24 visit that that wouldn't stop the Catholic Church from intervening in ethical matters or issues that dealt with man's \"eternal destiny.\"\n",
      "Ruini, Benedict's vicar for Rome, seems to have taken that message to heart. During a speech last week, the cardinal, who is also the head of Italian bishops conference, discussed the upcoming Italian budget, the state of the school system, and even the fate of Italy's embattled central bank governor.\n",
      "But most significantly, he chimed in on the hottest issue of the day, saying that giving full legal recognition to unmarried couples would represent an \"eclipsing of the nature and value of a family and a very grave harm to the Italian people.\"\n",
      "Although he did suggest that common-law norms might offer some protections, opponents seized on what they saw as unwarranted interference by the church in domestic affairs.\n",
      "\"The bishops' conference is the most powerful, listened-to, courted _ and feared _ lobby on the political scene,\" La Repubblica, a left-leaning Rome daily, said in a recent editorial.\n",
      "Ruini's comments came on the heels of intense recent activity by the church on the national political front.\n",
      "Earlier this year, the bishops' conference organized the boycott on the assisted fertility referendum. And the conference's newspaper has defended embattled Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio, known to be a practicing Catholic, who is facing calls for his resignation over his handling of two recent bank takeovers.\n",
      "The Vatican's influence in Italy is long established, and seems to endure even if citizens have strayed from Church doctrine _ notably by approving divorce and abortion in referendums decades ago _ and the country, like the rest of Europe, becomes ever more secular.\n",
      "More than 90 percent of Italy's 58 million citizens are, at least nominally, Catholic.\n",
      "But just how that influence will play out in general elections pitting Premier Silvio Berlusconi's conservative coalition against the center-left alliance remains to be seen.\n",
      "Ruini said the Italian church would take no political sides and limit itself to \"calling everybody's attention, and especially that of believers, to the principles and criteria of the Catholic Church's social teaching.\"\n",
      "But La Repubblica said, \"Nobody can afford to openly oppose the episcopal hierarchy.\"\n",
      "Romano Prodi, the center-left leader expected to challenge Berlusconi at next year's vote, got a taste of that in recent days.\n",
      "His proposal to give legal recognition to unmarried couples stirred the angry reaction of the Vatican, whose daily newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, described the idea as an attempt to tear apart Italian families in exchange for votes.\n",
      "Prodi quickly clarified his position saying he never supported gay marriage.\n",

      "Corsica was nearly cut off from mainland Europe on Friday with strikes spreading to airports, maritime links severed and a rocket attack adding to mounting tensions.\n",
      "The unrest on the Mediterranean island, sparked initially by plans to privatize a state ferry company, was shaping up as one of the most serious tests for the young administration of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin since President Jacques Chirac appointed him in late May.\n",
      "Chirac condemned Thursday night's rocket attack that targeted a government building in Ajaccio on the west coast.\n",
      "No injuries were reported and no one immediately claimed responsibility.\n",
      "It was not clear whether the blast was the work of Corsican nationalists or linked to anger over the privatization plans for ferry operator SNCM, which runs services between the island and the French mainland.\n",
      "Corsica has suffered more than two decades of low-level violence by organized crime gangs and separatists seeking independence from France. Bomb attacks generally occur at night, when buildings are empty.\n",
      "Nationalists have joined strikers in protests this week against the SNCM privatization plans, particularly after Villepin called Wednesday on police commandos to retake a ferry commandeered by striking sailors. If convicted of highjacking, the sailors face 20 years in prison.\n",
      "Four of the striking sailors were detained, fueling the angry protests. Authorities on Friday moved toward prosecuting two of the sailors by placing them under investigation _ a step short of formal charges.\n",
      "The four, however, were set free late Friday _ drawing cheers in the port of Bastia followed by declarations of defiance.\n",
      "\"The mobilization worked and our friends have come back,\" said Jean Brignole, secretary of the Corsican Workers Union, adding that a large protest planned for Saturday would go ahead as scheduled \"to show the government that the fight is still on.\"\n",
      "Corsica's airports experienced delays Friday because of the strikes.\n",
      "Maritime traffic with the mainland was completely stopped, as were links to the Italian island of Sardinia.\n",
      "Under pressure, the government has backed down from its initial plan to fully privatize SNCM, offering Thursday to keep 25 percent of the company.\n",
      "The government needs EU approval. It got a provisional green light Friday from the European Commission, but also was told that government funds should not be used merely to bolster the loss-making operator but to help it return to profitability.\n",

      "MADRID, Spain\n",
      "Catalan politicians Wednesday presented Spain's Parliament with a potentially explosive new charter that describes their wealthy northeastern region as \"a nation.\"\n",
      "The charter, which seeks to redefine Catalonia's relationship with central government, has seriously split political parties and voters over its implications for the unity of the country.\n",
      "Ernest Benach, president of the regional Catalan parliament, presented the charter in the Congress registry office. As he entered, about 20 protesters outside held up small posters that read, \"Spain R.I.P.\" They chanted \"Spain is indivisible\" and \"Catalonia is Spain.\"\n",
      "Catalonia's semiautonomous parliament, one of 17 in Spain, approved the statute last Friday with 120 votes in favor and just 15 votes of the right-wing Popular Party against, ending months of debate.\n",
      "\"Catalonia is a nation,\" according to the first article in the 52-page document. \"Catalonia considers Spain a many-nation state.\"\n",
      "Through this charter, Catalonia proposes to collect its own taxes and then pay central government its share. Currently, the reverse applies. It also calls for Catalonia to have its own independent judiciary.\n",
      "It must be approved by the Madrid-based national Parliament to become valid, but some legal experts warn it may be unconstitutional.\n",
      "The Popular Party, meanwhile, alleges the charter represents a step toward the dismemberment of Spain and has called on its some 700,000 members to fight it at every level. In addition, members of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialist party view the charter as damaging to Spain.\n",
      "Its passage through Parliament, a process that could take two months _ is seen as a major test for Zapatero's minority government, which relies on two pro-charter Catalan political groups for survival.\n",
      "Zapatero, who supports debate on the issue, was to meet for talks on the issue with Catalan regional president and fellow Socialist party member Pascual Maragall, later Wednesday. Both agreed not to comment on the meeting afterward.\n",
      "\"This charter is not against anyone,\" Benach told reporters. \"It's simply in favor of Catalonia.\n",
      "\"It doesn't aim to break anything. It's not a declaration of independence, by any means.\"\n",
      "Benach stressed that the document needed to be debated and not rejected out of hand.\n",
      "\"I ask all political forces, especially the Popular Party of Mariano Rajoy, to open the door to dialogue, to democratic debate,\" said Benach, pointing out that the charter had been approved by more than 90 percent of the Catalan parliament.\n",
      "Artur Mas, head of the Catalan coalition, Convergence and Union, insisted the proposed charter would simply allow Catalonia greater self government \"within the unity of the state.\"\n",
      "Around 7 million Catalans _ 16 percent of Spain's population _ account for over 18 percent of the country's financial productivity. Madrid, with 6 million inhabitants, is the country's economic powerhouse.\n",

      "Benedict issued a message that was read out Thursday during a commemoration of the \"Nostra Aetate\" document of the Second Vatican Council, in which the Catholic Church deplored anti-Semitism and repudiated the \"deicide\" charge that blamed Jews as a people for Christ's death.\n",
      "Rome's chief rabbi, Riccardo di Segni, said he had refused to attend the ceremony because of the presence of one of the keynote speakers, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, a Jewish convert to Catholicism.\n",
      "\"It's not a protest, but an invitation to reflect on the meaning of dialogue\" between religions, Di Segni told The Associated Press. \"If it means losing one's identity and crossing over to the other side, then it's not dialogue.\"\n",

      "The German-born Benedict, who attended the 1962-1965 Vatican meeting as a young theologian, praised \"Nostra Aetate\" in his message for having laid the foundations for a new relationship between Catholics and Jews.\n",
      "\"On this anniversary ... we need to renew our commitment to the work that yet remains to be done,\" he said. \"The Jewish-Christian dialogue must continue to enrich and deepen the bonds of friendship which have developed, while preaching and catechesis must be committed to ensuring that our mutual relations are presented in the light of the principles set forth by the council.\"\n",
      "He said that, in the future, he hoped theological dialogue as well as everyday contacts between Christians and Jews would offer a \"shared witness\" to the promotion of human dignity, the sanctity of life and the need to build a world of justice and peace.\n",
      "Rabbi David Rosen, who helped negotiate diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Israel, said \"Nostra Aetate,\" issued following the Holocaust, had had \"truly revolutionary\" implications.\n",

      "Parent of strike-troubled Irish Ferries reports net losses for 2005\n",
      "DUBLIN, Ireland\n",
      "The parent of Irish Ferries, which suffered a three-week strike last year over its decision to dump unionized local workers in favor of low-wage Eastern Europeans, reported a full-year net loss Monday citing the high cost of layoffs and lost business.\n",
      "Irish Continental Group PLC, which also runs shipping container services and port facilities, said it lost euro15.6 million (US$18.8 million) last year, compared to a net profit of euro5.5 million in 2004. It attributed the poor performance chiefly to the euro29.1 million (US$35 million) it paid in 2005 as compensation to 500 laid-off Irish employees at a cost exceeding euro60,000 (US$72,000) each.\n",
      "In November, Irish Ferries services ground to a halt when union leaders took control of two of the company's four vessels. The dispute fueled public unease about Ireland's policy of unrestricted immigration from the new European Union nations of Eastern Europe, which has supplied more than 150,000 low-wage workers in less than two years to Ireland's long-booming economy.\n",
      "On Dec. 7, in the biggest labor protests seen in Ireland since the mid-1980s, union leaders led more than 100,000 protesters onto the streets of Dublin and several other cities to decry the Irish Ferries staff plans. Protest leaders insisted they wanted Irish labor standards provided for all workers and weren't hostile to block Eastern European immigration.\n",
      "The strike ended Dec. 14 when Irish Continental directors confirmed lucrative payouts to those leaving and guaranteed Ireland's minimum wage of euro7.65 (US$9.20) to the imported workers, about double what the company had originally planned to pay.\n",
      "But the group's chief executive, John McGuckian, said Monday that the confrontation had been worth it, because now Irish Ferries' services linking Ireland with Britain and France were running at much lower labor costs in line with competition from no-frills airlines.\n",
      "\"There has been some loss of revenue through industrial action,' McGuckian said, \"but we are confident we have taken a major step forward in reducing our cost base, which underpins our ability to serve our customer base and which will give us the ability to compete effectively in 2006 and beyond.\"\n",
      "The company said passenger numbers fell 6.6 percent in 2005 to 1.49 million people, while vehicle numbers fell 4.5 percent to 366,000. It said this reflected the strike and a 9 percent decline in the number of tourists taking their cars by ferry to Ireland.\n",
      "Despite this, Irish Continental said its revenues rose slightly to euro298.7 million (US$360 million) from euro293.3 million in 2004.\n",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark\n",
      "Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller on Monday received a petition with 60,000 signatures calling for reconciliation between Denmark and the Muslim world following the crisis over the Prophet Mohammed cartoons.\n",
      "Organizers of the campaign \"Forsoning Nu,\" or \"Reconciliation Now,\" urged all parties, particularly the governments of Denmark and other countries involved in the dispute, \"to work together to solve the conflict.\"\n",
      "\"It's a good initiative and it shows that Danes want to move on,\" Moeller told reporters when he received the petition.\n",
      "The Muhammad cartoons were first published in September by a Danish newspaper, which said it was challenging self-censorship among artists dealing with Islam.\n",
      "The conflict simmered for months before erupting into a firestorm of protests in the Muslim world, including attacks on Western embassies and a boycott of Danish goods.\n",
      "Critics say the Danish government mishandled the crisis by refusing to apologize to Muslims and not granting Muslim ambassadors a meeting with the prime minister. The government has repeatedly said it cannot be held responsible for the actions of an independent newspaper.\n",
      "The petition noted that there was \"a distinction between the opinions expressed by a Danish newspaper and the opinions of the Danish people as a whole.\"\n",
      "The document renounced the drawings but stopped short of urging the Danish government to give an official apology.\n",
      "Organizers said 60,136 signed the petition on the Internet, posting their names and addresses. It will also be given to diplomats from Muslim countries including Bosnia, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Indonesia and Pakistan.\n",

      "SOFIA, Bulgaria\n",
      "The Supreme Court has struck down a government decision to stop the privatization of a major Bulgarian power plant, clearing the way for the sale of the utility to Greek Public Power Corporation, the court said Wednesday.\n",
      "The Greek company last April offered euro105 million (US$125 million) for the Bobov Dol coal-fired power plant and won the privatization tender against Italy's ENEL.\n",
      "The privatization agency, however, canceled the planned sale, saying both offers were unsatisfactory. Its decision appeared to have been forced by weeklong miners' protests against the deal. Miners' unions argued that once the Bobov Dol plant is sold, its new owners could stop buying local coal, leading to mine closures and leaving at least 10,000 miners jobless.\n",
      "The PPC challenged the privatization agency's decision in court, and on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the Greek company's offer was not unsatisfactory because it coincided with independent assessments of the plant's market price. The court ordered the government to start privatization talks with the PPC.\n",
      "The court ruling can be appealed, but the defendant _ the government privatization agency _ has backed the Greek company's claims, telling court that it should not have stopped the sale.\n",
      "It was not immediately clear when talks with PPC could start, or when a deal could be reached.\n",

      "Police fired tear gas to disperse youths at the end of the Paris march. They turned water canons on protesters who moved across town to the Sorbonne, torching the entrance of a nearby Gap clothing store and dismantling a section of a barricade erected to keep protesters at bay.\n",
      "Hours after marches ended, new protests erupted at the Sorbonne in the heart of Paris' Left Bank. Police fired tear gas and turned a water cannon on several hundred students who hurled bottles, boards and other projectiles at security forces barricaded behind a tall metal structure blocking off the domes university.\n",
      "In an apparent bid to set afire a police van serving as a blockade, protesters instead torched the entrance of The Gap, on the corner of the Sorbonne square. They had earlier attacked a McDonald's restaurant, a car and store fronts at the close of the march.\n",

      "Arbitration effort fails in German public workers' strike\n",
      "STUTTGART, Germany\n",
      "Arbitrators' efforts to help end a six-week strike by public workers in southwestern Germany failed Monday when negotiators rejected their proposal for solving the dispute over working hours.\n",
      "The strike in Baden-Wuerttemberg state is part of a wider dispute that has seen the ver.di union stage rolling strikes in most German regions _ the biggest public service stoppage in 14 years.\n",
      "Municipal authorities and the union brought in two arbitrators last week after failing to find a deal on their own. However, they rejected a proposal by arbitrators that would have extended employees' working weeks depending on their qualifications.\n",
      "Union representatives \"could not agree to the extension of working time,\" said ver.di's chief negotiator, Alfred Wohlfart.\n",
      "Local authorities have been pressing some employees to work 40 hours a week, compared with 38 1/2 hours at present, without extra pay. The union argues that lengthening hours would destroy jobs.\n",
      "The union said the arbitrators' proposal would have resulted in an average work week of some 39.1 hours _ which, Wohlfart argued, would have led to 3,500 jobs being lost.\n",
      "Employers say more work and greater flexibility are needed given that government budgets are tight.\n",
      "\"Citizens expect an immediate end to the strike,\" said Mannheim Mayor Gerhard Widder, the chief negotiator for employers. He called for the two sides to use the arbitrators' proposal as a basis for further talks.\n",
      "Wohlfart said ver.di would continue its strike campaign, but insisted that \"we have an absolute interest\" in a settlement. He did not say when talks might resume.\n",
      "The dispute has left mounds of garbage piled up in some places, and has forced hospitals to cancel non-urgent operations. Still, not all workers have walked out simultaneously, limiting disruption, and deals have been reached to end strikes in two other regions.\n",
      "In Stuttgart, authorities already have brought in private firms to clear garbage. The chief negotiator for state governments warned that the dispute could trigger more such moves.\n",
      "\"If (the union) continues to insist on short working time, there will be more privatization,\" Hartmut Moellring told N24 television.\n",
      "In a separate dispute over pay and conditions, doctors at German public hospitals on Monday extended a strike they had started last week.\n",

      "It called on doctors at 15 clinics across Germany to walk out Monday.\n",

      "BERLIN\n",
      "Doctors at 20 state-run German hospitals were on strike Tuesday, their main union said, stepping up pressure for a large pay hike and an end to unpaid overtime.\n",
      "The strike affected 11 university hospitals and nine psychiatric clinics, the Marburger Bund union said. On Monday, doctors walked out at 15 clinics.\n",
      "The union is seeking an increase of up to 30 percent in basic wages for 22,000 doctors at university and state hospitals, along with better-regulated working hours and full overtime payments.\n",
      "The stoppages, which began last Thursday, are restricting non-urgent patient care, though emergency and intensive-care services are unaffected.\n",
      "Union officials say doctors deserve a raise because of extensions in their working hours, cuts in traditional Christmas and holiday payments and failure to pay overtime in recent years. They say they will accept a longer regulation working week in return.\n",
      "However, state governments, under pressure to cut costs because of mounting debts, have denounced the strikes as irresponsible and say they cannot afford such a large pay increase.\n",
      "Marburger Bund chief Frank Montgomery said Tuesday that the doctors were \"capable of escalation\" if employers don't offer a pay increase. \"We feel we have been treated disgracefully,\" he said.\n",
      "He said doctors would hold a major demonstration in the central city of Hanover on Wednesday.\n",
      "The doctors' strike coincides with a wider dispute over working hours for public employees ranging from garbage collectors to highway maintenance workers, which has resulted in weeks of strikes.\n",
      "Local authorities have been pressing some employees to work 40 hours a week, compared with 38 1/2 hours at present, without extra pay.\n",
      "The ver.di service workers' union argues that lengthening hours would destroy jobs, but employers say more work and greater flexibility are needed as they wrestle with strapped budgets.\n",
      "The main IG Metall industrial union also is threatening a wave of warning strikes unless employers improve their response to its demand for a 5-percent pay rise for Germany's 3.4 million manufacturing workers.\n",
      "\"We want a solution at the negotiating table, so I urge (employers) to finally put forward an offer worth negotiating,\" IG Metall labor union chief Berthold Huber said Tuesday.\n",
      "The union points to improvements in productivity and strong corporate profits, but employers have argued that wages can be raised by only 1.2 percent and that a large hike could undermine Germany's hesitant economic recovery.\n",

      "ROME\n",
      "Italy is in a state of high alert ahead of elections next month that will be the nation's first major vote in decades to be held under the shadow of terrorism.\n",
      "A recent domestic intelligence report included Italy among \"possible targets\" of a Jihadist terror offensive, and said the period of greatest danger was between last month's Winter Olympics in Turin and the April 9-10 general elections.\n",
      "Even the U.S. State Department took the step this week of warning Americans of \"security concerns in Italy\" ahead of the vote.\n",
      "\"The risk of terrorism is for now a theoretical one ... So far we have received no specific signals of an attack,\" Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu said when parliament was dissolved last month, clearing the way for the election. \"But we keep our defenses very high.\"\n",
      "Italian officials said Friday that the situation has not changed since then.\n",
      "Italy last voted in general elections in May 2001, four months before the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Bombings in Spain and Britain _ which like Italy were part of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq _ raised fears that Italy could also be targeted by Islamic terrorism.\n",
      "\"An election, as previous experience in other countries shows, can be appealing for terrorist groups who are not only looking for the spotlight but also for a chance to influence people's choices,\" said Pisanu.\n",
      "In March 2004 in Madrid, Islamic militants claimed responsibility for an attack on Madrid three days ahead of the elections, which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,500. Two days after the attack, Islamic militants said they had acted on behalf of al-Qaida in revenge for then-prime minister Jose Maria Aznar's deployment of peacekeeping troops to Iraq.\n",
      "Premier Silvio Berlusconi is a staunch ally of U.S. President George W. Bush, and many here fear that this pro-American stance, as well as the country's involvement in Iraq, may increase the risk of a terror attack.\n",
      "Italy has received threats from reputed Islamic militants on the Internet, and Berlusconi said recently that \"numerous threats\" made against him were deemed credible by investigators, without giving details.\n",
      "Thousands of sites in Italy, including airports, foreign embassies and government buildings, are considered \"sensitive\" and are kept under tight surveillance. Officials said polling stations are also considered \"sensitive.\"\n",
      "The government sent 3,000 troops to Iraq to help rebuild the country after the ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003. It is now withdrawing the contingent, and expects the pullout to be complete by the end of the year. Prodi, who was against the war, said he favors a quick but phased pullout.\n",
      "The U.S. State Department told Americans on Wednesday that Italy continues to be under heightened public threat by al-Qaida and other Islamic extremists for its continued participation in multinational activities in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n",
      "That advisory grabbed the political spotlight Thursday, with Berlusconi defending the U.S. government's right to inform its citizens, and his center-left opponent Romano Prodi saying the advisory created a climate of fear.\n",
      "Domestic terrorism cast its shadow on Italian elections in the 1970s and early 1980s, most notably with the Red Brigades radical leftist group. But this is the first time the country has feared an attack by Islamic terrorists during parliamentary elections.\n",
      "The Italian intelligence report issued last month said \"possible targets of the Jihad offensive include Italy.\"\n",
      "The report warned that the greater danger comes from \"free-lance\" terrorists _ which it described as people typically raised in the West and with loose affiliation to organized militant groups _ and North Africans connected to groups inspired by al-Qaida.\n",
      "Enzo Bianco, a leftist lawmaker who heads a parliamentary commission that oversees the country's secret services, said the report \"highlights a worrying agitation in the activity of Islamic terrorists in Italy.\"\n",
      "All leading Italian politicians are heavily guarded, moving around in bulletproof cars _ a legacy of the years of domestic terror. Berlusconi and Prodi have major security details, and are surrounded by plainclothes bodyguards.\n",
      "Italy heightened its security levels after the July 7 bombings on three London subways and a double-decker bus killed 56 people, including the four suicide bombers, and injured hundreds.\n",
      "A tight security plan surrounded the Olympics, with the deployment of 10,000 police reinforced by soldiers and AWACS surveillance planes provided by NATO. The Games went ahead without any disruptions.\n",
      "Domestic anarchists and other radical groups that have been active in recent months have added to the security concerns.\n",
      "In December, demonstrations against a high-speed train linking Turin to Lyon, France, turned violent in an Alpine valley. Earlier this month, hundreds of radical leftists _ who were protesting a march by neo-fascist sympathizers _ torched cars, damaged stores and clashed with police in Milan.\n",
      "Berlusconi got a taste of the tensions when youths scuffled with police this week outside a theater in Genoa, in northern Italy, where he was leading an election rally. The premier accused the left of organizing protests to disrupt his election campaign.\n",

      "PARIS\n",
      "The French government spokesman called Sunday for \"team spirit\" to pull the country out of a crisis over a hotly contested youth labor law, but unions looked to a new round of protests and strikes this week to get the measure repealed.\n",
      "Unions were hoping that Tuesday's nationwide protests would exceed a similar demonstration a week ago that put at least 1 million people in the streets. The Paris Metro, the national train service and others were already announcing scaled-back service.\n",
      "Scores of universities and high schools have been closed or blocked by protesting students, and Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, author of the measure, has been weakened, perhaps irreparably, in a crisis that has deepened from week to week.\n",
      "President Jacques Chirac, searching for a way out, said Friday that a new, softer law would be devised with two key modifications that take opponents' concerns into account. He called for dialogue to ensure all viewpoints are heard. Previous efforts at dialogue failed.\n",
      "The contested measure nevertheless went on the books Sunday with the signature of Chirac, who had said he would sign it into law because it had been passed by parliament. In a twist that apparently is a first in France he asked that the law so vigorously defended by Villepin, to his detriment, not be applied.\n",
      "The law, known as the New Job Contract, was aimed at curbing sky-high youth unemployment by making it easier to hire those under 26 because they could be fired without cause in the first two years.\n",
      "Chirac has asked that the current law be modified to reduce a trial period for new young hires from two years to one and, in case of a firing, to require employers to explain it.\n",
      "The president's double-barreled approach, signing a law onto the books then effectively suspending it so a new law can be written, was seen as a rebuff of Villepin.\n",
      "It showed that Chirac believes that Villepin's chief political rival, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy _ who has wanted the measure suspended _ was right.\n",
      "A decision announced Saturday to turn the writing of a second bill over to parliament _ removing it from the hands of the government _ was viewed as a further insult to the prime minister.\n",
      "The move put Sarkozy at center-stage in pulling the country out of the crisis. The ambitious interior minister hopes to be a presidential candidate in 2007 elections for the governing Union for a Popular Movement, or UMP, which he heads.\n",
      "Sarkozy immediately began contacting unions for talks, and Cope, the government spokesman tried to rally opponents.\n",
      "\"There are positive points that we must discuss without taboo,\" Cope said on the TF1 television station. \"We must get together around a table to get out of this difficult period by the high road.\"\n",
      "However, the head of the CFDT union predicted that the struggle would be long, and not lose momentum with spring vacations starting next week.\n",
      "Political opponents, meanwhile, castigated Chirac's decision to put the old law on the books but replace it with another law as \"surrealist,\" \"bizarre\" and \"undemocratic.\"\n",
      "Centrist leader Francois Bayrou denounced \"the delegation of government power to the president of UMP,\" the governing party.\n",
      "\"We are in a full regime crisis,\" he said on LCI television.\n",
      "Villepin, in an interview with the weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, said he did not feel disavowed by Chirac, who is thought to have wanted him as his successor in the presidency.\n",
      "\"There is misunderstanding and incomprehension about the direction of my action. I profoundly regret it,\" he told Le Journal du Dimanche. Asked if he had made mistakes, he replied, \"of course, in all political action there is some error.\"\n",
      "But, he added, \"the main error, the only one that would have been unforgivable, would have been to do nothing against the mass unemployment in our country.\"\n",
      "CFDT union chief Francois Chereque told France Inter radio Sunday that the mobilization against the law must continue.\n",
      "\"The object of (Tuesday's) demonstration is repealing\" the law, he said. \"There needs to be a lot of us, and we must go for the long haul since the parliamentary debate will take time.\"\n",

      "The government promised Tuesday to keep Olympic Airways flying during the summer, despite a European Union warning over illegal subsidies and an admission the national carrier's debts are \"considerably higher than euro600 million (US$730 million).\"\n",
      "\"Olympic Airways will be flying at Easter and through the summer ... after that, we will do everything we can to achieve the best possible result,\" Deputy Finance Minister Petros Doukas said.\n",
      "On Tuesday, European Union regulators warned that Greece must recover euro161 million (US$194 million) in illegal aid to the airline or face fines.\n",
      "The European Commission said it would ask the EU's high court to impose financial penalties if Greece did not respond within two months.\n",
      "Doukas said the total amount owed from subsidy payments was about euro600 million but that additional financial losses suffered by the airline had added to the debt.\n",
      "\"I don't want to say how high the debt is, but it is considerably higher than euro600 million,\" Doukas told private Alpha television.\n",
      "The Greek government in November postponed plans to privatize the company, now renamed Olympic Airlines, after an earlier EU ruling on the illegal subsidies. A string of financial rescue plans and privatization bids have failed.\n",
      "Doukas said several investors were interested in buying the carrier, including Greek ship owners, \"Arab financial groups,\" and \"overseas venture capitalists\" but that a sale was only possible if debts were cleared.\n",
      "\"I won't tell you the tricks we will use ... we're working on the best legal arguments we can come up with,\" Doukas said, adding that money owed Olympic through travel by government officials could be used to offset some of the debt.\n",

      "DUBLIN, Ireland\n",
      "The assassination of a Sinn Fein official who had admitted spying for the British will make a new power-sharing deal in Northern Ireland more difficult, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern told lawmakers Wednesday.\n",
      "Despite this, Ahern said he and British Prime Minister Tony Blair would reveal a long-awaited new plan Thursday in Armagh, Northern Ireland, that aims to forge a Catholic-Protestant administration led by leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party, and their bitter Protestant rivals from the Democratic Unionist Party.\n",
      "\"We have made it clear that the two governments will not be deterred from efforts to bring politics center stage in Northern Ireland,\" Ahern said. \"So Tony Blair and I will travel to Armagh tomorrow and get on with it.\"\n",
      "Ahern said Tuesday's killing of Denis Donaldson in northwest Ireland had heightened Protestant opposition to sharing power with Sinn Fein. He said the killing \"certainly makes it more difficult.\"\n",
      "Donaldson, 55, had been living alone at his vacation home since December, when he went on national Irish television to confess he had been a British agent inside Sinn Fein for decades. The IRA traditionally killed anybody suspected of spying for the British, but the outlawed group last year announced it had renounced violence and disarmed _ and on Tuesday denied killing Donaldson.\n",
      "Ahern said officers from the Irish Republic's national police force visited Donaldson's home in January to warn him he could be a target, and gave him the telephone number of the nearest police station. He said mobile police patrols occasionally drove past Donaldson's home, but the former Sinn Fein bureaucrat refused an offer of formal police protection.\n",
      "Ahern said Donaldson's betrayal of comrades in Sinn Fein and the IRA meant he had many enemies. \"But whoever was responsible for this evil deed was certainly no friend of the peace process,\" he said.\n",
      "In London, Blair _ speaking publicly for the first time about Donaldson's killing _ called it \"a serious, appalling, barbaric act.\" He said it would have \"serious implications\" if police determined that IRA members were responsible, and emphasized that Sinn Fein \"has to be clean of all this.\" But he said delaying Thursday's announcement would only reward the killers.\n",
      "\"The timing of this (killing) does suggest that whoever did this wants to derail the peace process. Our response should be to deny them what they want,\" Blair said.\n",
      "Blair added that dissident IRA hard-liners opposed to Sinn Fein's political direction might have killed Donaldson specifically to sabotage the new diplomatic effort. \"Sometimes these things can be perpetrated by people in disagreement with their leadership,\" he said.\n",

      "Students more intent on protesting than studying have been at the forefront of France's weekslong standoff with the government over a new jobs law that would make firing young workers easier. More protests were planned Tuesday.\n",
      "But President Jacques Chirac's announcement Monday that he would give in to protesters' demands and scrap the most contested part of the law, a so-called \"first jobs contract,\" has thrown the movement into disarray.\n",
      "Following the announcement, the mood outside the University of Paris-Jussieu was sober. Striking students, who closed down the sprawling campus on Paris' Left Bank more than a month ago, were divided over whether the barricades should come down.\n",

      "LONDON\n",
      "A hunger strike led by African and Turkish asylum seekers protesting long stays at British detention centers entered its second week Wednesday.\n",
      "Hundreds of detainees at the Colnbrook Immigration Removal Center in Middlesex, on the outskirts of London, began a hunger strike on April 8 after officers quelled a protest at the facility.\n",
      "Hunger strikes spread to two other immigration detention centers in Britain last week after detainees began meeting under the auspices of church gatherings. The asylum seekers, who are mainly from Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria and Congo, have since dubbed their protest \"Cry Freedom.\"\n",
      "Britain's Home Office, which classifies a hunger strike as the refusal of four consecutive meals, said Wednesday that only seven of the more than 200 inmates who started the hunger strike are still refusing food. None of those inmates have required medical attention, said Home Office spokesman Darcy Mitchell.\n",
      "But one of the protesting detainees, 29-year-old George Mwangi, of Kenya, said that many detainees have renewed their strikes after government officials' promises to look into their grievances resulted in no changes.\n",
      "\"We have been here for so long and, when he came with no new answers, we decided to take up the fight again,\" said Mwangi, who has been detained at Colnbrook for 10 months after his asylum application was rejected. \"There doesn't seem to be an end to it.\"\n",
      "Another detainee, John Turkson, a 36-year-old civil engineer from Ghana, said he has refused to eat for 10 days and refused to drink for a week. Speaking by phone from the Colnbrook on Wednesday, Turkson said his health is rapidly deteriorating due to malnutrition and Tuberculosis.\n",
      "\"I ran away from torture in Africa and I'm experiencing torture here in the U.K.,\" said Turkson, who has been held in British immigration facilities since October.\n",
      "Colnbrook, one of Britain's 10 immigration detention centers, holds people detained for overstaying their visas, illegally entering the country or those who have failed to gain political asylum prior to their removal from the country.\n",
      "It also holds a smaller proportion of detainees whose cases have not yet been decided, but who are considered to be at risk of absconding, or whose identities are being established.\n",
      "Tension between detainees and British officials reached a boiling point Saturday when about two dozen people held at the Haslar Immigration Removal Center in Gosport, southern England, staged a demonstration by refusing to leave an exercise area at the facility.\n",

      "Police posted outside the building had been on alert for any signs that radical groups could disrupt classes. But protesters _ from various Paris universities, not just the Sorbonne _ were able to enter the building using their student ID cards.\n",
      "Weeks of massive street demonstrations have dwindled since President Jacques Chirac's government voted to scrap the youth jobs law, which would have made it easier for companies to hire and fire young workers. Some demonstrators have continued pressing wider demands concerning the government's job policies.\n",
      "The Sorbonne's column-lined main building on Paris' Left Bank became a symbol of the standoff after students occupied it March 8-11 and riot police stormed in to dislodge them.\n",
      "Boudot said the protesters were not representative of the 12,000 students enrolled at the Sorbonne.\n",
      "\"The vast majority of students that we talked to today wanted to return to class,\" he said.\n",
      "The university has asked for police to intervene, Boudot said, adding that the protesters were the same ones who had occupied the building in March.\n",
      "The Sorbonne was shut for six weeks while workers carried out euro550,000 (US$677,000) in repairs and during its regularly scheduled spring break, which ended Monday.\n",
      "During much of the protest movement, the Sorbonne's facade was barricaded behind a high metal screen where police with water canons were entrenched. The streets outside the school remained a gathering point for protesters, who saw regular scuffles with police.\n",
      "Other universities around France reopened Monday for the first time since the protests, and the government minister in charge of higher education, Francois Goulard, said on France 2 television that the return to class was normal \"practically everywhere.\"\n",

      "A top official with Germany's leading Jewish organization urged the government Wednesday to strengthen efforts against extremist groups in the wake of election results that gave seats in a regional parliament to a far-right party.\n",
      "\"Violent persecution of immigrants takes place on a daily basis and unfortunately the authorities look the other way,\" said Stephan Kramer, general secretary of the Central Council of German Jews. \"Anyone who thinks that this is only a problem of skinheads and less well-off people is completely wrong.\"\n",
      "The National Democratic Party, known by its German initials NPD, won 7.3 percent of the vote in the northeastern region of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, entitling it to six seats in the local legislature. The NPD has made no secret of its harsh anti-foreigner stance and has praised Nazi-era economic and education policies.\n",
      "Mecklenburg has Germany's highest unemployment rate at 18.2 percent. But Kramer said naming unemployment as the only reason for increasing right-wing extremism oversimplified the problem, saying right-wing attitudes were more broadly distributed.\n",
      "Right-wing graffiti, defiled cemeteries and violent attacks on minorities, particularly in Berlin and its surrounding area, are part of an omnipresent xenophobic atmosphere, he said.\n",
      "\"The disenchantment with politics also plays a role,\" he said, emphasizing that politicians have to be brave enough to take unpopular but necessary steps to create trust on a long-term basis.\n",
      "Kramer cited government figures showing the number of right-wing motivated acts of violence rose from 776 in 2004 to 959 last year.\n",
      "The previous government under Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder tried to ban the NPD, but the move was blocked by the Supreme Court when it was discovered that the government's case was based in part on inflammatory statements made by paid government informants.\n",
      "Kramer spoke at a news conference in Berlin along with other advocates for programs to combat extremism and foster democratic attitudes in the formerly communist east. Those programs were begun in 2001 under Schroeder.\n",

      "The attack Tuesday night raised the specter of the violence that racked poor suburbs last year. It came amid reports of growing suburban delinquency, with the prefect of the Essonne region, where the incident occurred, saying that youth gangs were engaged in \"acts of war.\"\n",
      "One of the officers, who sustained a double skull fracture, was undergoing surgery Wednesday at a Paris hospital, a police official said. The other was released after treatment from a hospital in Evry.\n",

      "\"The youths were waiting in ambush in the woods and jumped out, their faces masked, to strike them with fists and pieces of wood,\" Joaquin Masanet, head of the UNSA-Police union, said in an interview. \"The two officers had fallen into a trap and they (youths) were hitting them to kill.\"\n",

      "The report said the government disregarded safety standards at the jail that contributed to the deaths last October of the illegal immigrants and suspected drug smugglers in the fire, apparently started by a prisoner.\n",
      "The report could be a costly embarrassment for the conservative government parties as the country prepares for elections Nov. 22.\n",
      "The report said there would have been \"fewer or no victims to mourn if the fire security had received (proper) attention from the organizations involved.\"\n",
      "The fire raised questions about whether the government sacrificed safety standards in its haste to deport immigrants when it ordered the complex's rapid construction in 2002.\n",
      "Council chairman Pieter van Vollenhoven declined to respond to questions about criminal liability or negligence. \"It's not up to us to determine guilt,\" he said. That would be up to public prosecutors.\n",
      "The political fallout of the report on public opinion also was not immediately clear, since the airport fire has not been a priority issue in the early days of the campaign.\n",
      "But opposition parties indicated they may try to keep the report on the public agenda.\n",
      "\"The building wasn't in order, the procedures weren't in order, people weren't trained, the cooperation wasn't good, and as the clincher the care afterward was also substandard,\" said Aleid Wolfsen, of the leading opposition party, Labor. \"It could hardly be worse.\"\n",
      "The long-awaited report said the Justice Ministry, the country's building inspection service, and the city of Haarlemmermeer, which has jurisdiction over the airport, \"failed on a number of points to adhere to the applicable laws and rules concerning fire safety.\"\n",
      "The 310-page report, released alongside a multimedia and video presentation that was nationally broadcast, listed a series of failures, including the lack of training in emergency procedures for the prison guards, faulty smoke and ventilation ducts and problems of access for fire trucks.\n",
      "The wing of the detention center where the fire broke out fell short of building regulations, it said. Pressure to build cells quickly may have come at the cost of fire security, but that pressure began to mount even before Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende was first elected in 2002, Van Vollenhoven said.\n",
      "\"I do not believe people are angry enough about this,\" said Toekaja Artist, the mother of Robbert Arah who died in the blaze, interviewed outside the parliament building where she joined a small demonstration.\n",
      "Janna Kodde, a protester who was unrelated to any of the victims, said she was pessimistic that the political fallout would damage conservative parties in the elections.\n",
      "\"There are many people who think refugees should not be locked up, but they keep voting for the parties from the right. So it's difficult to say if this will be a hot issue for the coming election,\" she said.\n",

      "Police detained more than 200 people Sunday after a youth rally in Copenhagen turned violent, with protesters hurling cobblestones, bottles and eggs at officers in riot gear.\n",
      "The demonstrators were protesting a court ruling last month ordering a group of young squatters to leave a downtown building and hand it over to a Christian congregation that bought it five years ago.\n",
      "About 800 people had rallied peacefully for two days, but clashes broke out when police tried to remove protesters staging a sit-down protest on a main Copenhagen boulevard, police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said.\n",
      "About 220 people were detained and face various offenses, including violence against officers, vandalism and refusing to obey police orders, he said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n",
      "Among those detained were German and Swedish nationals who were in Copenhagen for the weekend protest, Munch said.\n",
      "In an Internet posting, organizers of the demonstration accused police of provoking the protesters.\n",
      "City authorities gave a group of young squatters the right to use the four-story building in 1982, but sold it in 2001 to the Father House community, a small Christian congregation that since has tried to evict the youth.\n",
      "The squatters have refused to leave, saying the city had no right to sell the building while it was still in use. The Eastern High Court turned town their appeal on Aug. 28 and ordered them out.\n",
      "Authorities say the building was used as a starting point for numerous demonstrations that turned violent in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n",

      "Europe's highest concrete rockfill dam was activated Thursday in the remote eastern Icelandic highlands amid a swirl of protest from environmentalists.\n",
      "The Karahnjukar dam is part of a hydroelectric project constructed by national energy company Landsvirkjun to power an aluminum smelter being built by the aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. in eastern Iceland.\n",
      "In temperatures hovering just above freezing, the murky green waters of the glacial Jokulsa a Dal river came to a slow halt at around 0930GMT as workers sealed off two locks.\n",
      "It was the first step in creating what will ultimately become a 57 square kilometer (22 square mile) reservoir, flooding a swathe of the Icelandic highlands.\n",
      "The project has been the subject of ongoing protests and calls to action by environmentalists in Iceland and abroad, including a peaceful protest march earlier this week in several of the nation's cities.\n",
      "Opponents of the dam and reservoir claim it will destroy wildlife habitats and is emblematic of Iceland making environmental and political sacrifices to attract the international aluminum industry.\n",
      "\"This project is sacrificing a big slice of land that would have been an excellent national park. It was land that was untouched, but the politicians thought that untouched meant it was unpopular and invaluable,\" said Andri Snaer Magnason, author of the book \"Dreamland, Self-Help for a Scared Nation.\"\n",
      "The hydroelectric project involves the damming of two glacial rivers, forcing water to flow through a 72 kilometer (45 mile) tunnel system to a powerhouse where energy is expected be generated by April 2007.\n",
      "Landsvirkjun said the US$1.5billion (euro1.18billion) investment to build the hydroelectric plant is the largest of its kind in Icelandic history.\n",
      "It will power Iceland's third aluminum smelter, but three more smelter projects are also under consideration around the country, including the expansion of an existing plant.\n",
      "\"The dam is a small part of the grand scale aluminum revolution. The idea is to make Iceland the largest aluminum smelter in the world,\" said Magnason.\n",
      "Supporters of the project believe the benefits that international investment will bring to Iceland outweigh the environmental loss.\n",
      "\"There are many true nature lovers -- I am a true nature lover,\" said Sigurdur Arnalds, a spokesman for Landsvirkjun. \"Some of those are not willing to make compromises that we sacrifice something for economic and social benefits.\n",

      "There was no violence during the early morning raid of several buildings in a housing project in Les Mureaux, in the Yvelines region west of Paris.

      "He and other members of AC-Le Feu, which grew out of last year's unrest, crisscrossed France in two painted minibuses in a monthslong tour of 120 suburbs and towns to meet with young and old and document their worries.\n",
      "Now, with an action that they hope awakens images of the 1789 French Revolution, they planned to bring a new voice of the people to Paris and hand over the notebooks to lawmakers.\n",
      "AC-Le Feu, a play on words for \"enough fire,\" also wants to give officials \"concrete, realizable proposals for a concrete problem,\" said Mihi.\n",
      "The group is looking to draw the disenfranchised into positive action and make them \"the voice of the greatest political party that can exist, that is to say the people,\" said Mohamed Mechmache, another AC-Le Feu founder.\n",
      "While politicians on the left have called for more government programs to integrate poor minority youth since the riots, the leading presidential contender on the right, Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, has sought to crack down on crime and immigration and echoed slogans of the extreme right.\n",

      "Concern that the poor suburbs -- home to many young French of immigrant origin angry over entrenched discrimination and unemployment -- could again explode has been heightened by several incidents over the past few weeks, including a bus burning in broad daylight and traps set by gangs for police.\n",

      "\"We will recommend continuing our fight in another form,\" union leader Dimitris Bratis said. Both unions said they will propose 24-hour strikes on Nov. 3 and 9.\n",
      "Primary and secondary school teachers are demanding increases in net starting salaries from around euro900 to euro1,400 (US$1,100 to US$1,750) -- which the government has ruled out -- and the allocation of more funds to education.\n",
      "If teachers vote to end the strike, education ministry and union officials are considering extending school hours and holding classes on holidays to make up for missed lessons.\n",
      "\"Without pressing pupils too much, we will find a way,\" union secretary general Polyzois Babouras said.\n",
      "But many secondary schools may remain closed as some 900 -- out of about 3,000 throughout Greece -- are under occupation by students who want the government to abolish a new minimum grade requirement of 10 out of 20 for admission to state universities and polytechnics. Teachers have backed this demand.\n",
      "The governing conservatives also face strong reactions from university staff and student unions over plans to end the state monopoly on tertiary education by allowing the creation of nonprofit private universities. This would require a constitutional amendment, which would come into effect after the next elections, set for March 2008.\n",
