A strike by Finnair cabin crews ended Friday after the flight attendants' union and airline managers accepted a mediation proposal by a negotiator.
The two-day strike, launched in protest to the national carrier's hiring policy, grounded Finnair's international flights, forcing thousands of passengers to find alternative forms of transport.
